Resulting losses severely eroded FPB’s earnings and capital, and negatively \\nimpacted liquidity, leading to the bank’s failure and a material loss to the DIF.   \\n \\nManagement.  FPB’s Board of Directors (BOD) did not ensure that bank management identified, \\nmeasured, monitored, and controlled the risk of the institution’s activities.  In addition, the BOD did \\nnot ensure that corrective actions were implemented in response to examiner and auditor \\nrecommendations.   Further, FPB developed a business plan governing its activities; however, the plan \\nwas not kept current or followed.  Although rapid asset growth, declining asset quality, and poor \\nearnings further increased liquidity risk, bank management did not put into place the necessary controls \\nfor liquidity management, including an adequate contingency liquidity plan (CLP). \\n \\nAsset Quality.  FPB’s CRE/ADC loans were concentrated in a rapidly growing local marketplace.   A \\nsignificant portion of the loan portfolio included high-risk terms, such as high loan-to-value ratios, \\ninterest-only basis with balloon payments, and interest reserves used to capitalize interest expense.  \\nHowever, FPB did not follow sound loan underwriting standards and administration practices, \\nincluding those pertaining to:  (1) effectively identifying loan portfolio risk, (2) obtaining current \\nappraisals and financial statements on borrowers and guarantors, (3) ensuring appropriate use and \\ncontrol over interest reserves, and (4) providing appropriate reports to the BOD on loan concentrations, \\nspeculative lending, and interest reserves.   Also, FPB did not maintain a sufficient allowance for loan \\nand lease losses (ALLL).  As asset quality declined and losses were recognized, FPB’s liquidity \\nposition became critical, and earnings and capital were eroded.   \\n \\n Supervision.  The FDIC and OFR conducted timely examinations of FPB.  Additionally, the FDIC \\nprovided oversight through its off-site monitoring process and accelerated examinations as a result of \\nidentified deficiencies.   As a result of the November 2006 examination, the FDIC delayed its approval \\nof three FPB branch applications until FPB provided information on how the bank would address \\nexamination concerns.  As a result of the September 2007 examination, and after various OFR and FPB \\ndiscussions regarding the bank’s condition and proposed regulatory actions, the FDIC, in conjunction \\nwith the OFR, took supervisory action in February 2008 to address management’s failure to implement \\ncorrective actions in response to audit and/or examiner concerns.  Such concerns included, but were not \\nlimited to, inadequate management oversight, poor asset quality, the need to increase capital and \\nimprove earnings, an inadequate ALLL, noncompliance with laws and regulations, and an outdated \\nliquidity policy.  Further, in March and May 2008, the FDIC notified FPB of applicable restrictions \\nunder PCA when FPB fell below the well capitalized category, and in June 2008, the FDIC issued a \\nPCA Directive.  The FDIC has authority to take a wide range of supervisory actions.  In the case of \\nFPB, however, supervisory actions were not always timely and effective in addressing the bank’s most \\nsignificant problems.   \\n \\nThe FDIC has taken steps to improve its supervisory review of business plans, oversight of financial \\ninstitutions that have CRE loan concentrations and use interest reserves, and CLPs.  However, FPB’s \\nloan documentation and administration deficiencies should have warranted greater concern during the \\n2006 examination.   Specifically, during that examination, FPB was in a de novo status; the loan \\nportfolio had begun to deteriorate and was highly concentrated in high-risk CRE/ADC loans; loan \\nadministration issues, identified as early as the FDIC’s 2004 examination, were uncorrected or in need \\nof improvement; ALLL was inadequate; and FPB’s risk profile was increasing.   Greater concern \\nregarding FPB’s loan documentation and administration deficiencies could have led to elevated \\nsupervisory attention and earlier supervisory action.   \\n \\nThe FDIC OIG plans to issue a summary report on the material loss reviews it is conducting and will \\nmake appropriate recommendations related to the failure of FPB and other FDIC-supervised banks at \\nthat time. \\n \\nManagement Response \\n \\nDSC provided a written response to the draft report.  DSC agreed with the OIG’s conclusions \\nregarding the causes of FPB’s failure and resulting material loss and the supervisory activities related \\nto FPB.   DSC also agreed that the results of the November 2006 examination related to FPB’s loan \\ndocumentation and administration deficiencies should have warranted greater supervisory action.   \\n      To view the full report, go to www.fdicig.gov/2009reports.asp\\n              \\n \\n \\n  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation \\n \\nWhy We Did The Audit \\n \\nAs required by section 38(k) of the \\nFederal Deposit Insurance (FDI) Act, \\nthe Office of Inspector General (OIG) \\nconducted a material loss review of the \\nfailure of First Priority Bank (FPB), \\nBradenton, Florida.   On August 1, 2008, \\nthe State of Florida, Office of Financial \\nRegulation (OFR), closed FPB and \\nnamed the FDIC as receiver.   On \\nAugust 19, 2008, the FDIC notified the \\nOIG that FPB’s total assets at closing \\nwere $241 million, and the estimated \\nloss to the Deposit Insurance Fund \\n(DIF) was $72 million. \\n \\nThe audit objectives were to \\n(1) determine the causes of the financial \\ninstitution’s failure and resulting \\nmaterial loss to the DIF and (2) evaluate \\nthe FDIC’s supervision of the \\ninstitution, including implementation of \\nthe Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) \\nprovisions of section 38. \\n \\nBackground \\n \\nFPB was a state-chartered nonmember \\nbank insured on December 8, 2003.   As \\na de novo bank for its first 3 years in \\noperation, FPB was subject to additional \\nsupervisory oversight and regulatory \\ncontrols, including the development and \\nmaintenance of a current business plan \\nand increased examination frequency.  \\nWith five branches in Florida, FPB \\nengaged principally in traditional \\nbanking activities within its local \\nmarketplace, which experienced a \\nsignificant economic downturn starting \\nin 2006.  FPB had no holding company, \\nsubsidiaries, or affiliates.   \\n \\nFPB’s assets consisted principally of \\ncommercial real estate (CRE) loans, \\nincluding a significant concentration in \\nresidential acquisition, development, \\nand construction (ADC) loans.   The \\nFDIC has recognized the increased risk \\nthat CRE loans present to financial \\ninstitutions and has issued guidance that \\ndescribes a risk management framework \\nto effectively identify, measure, \\nmonitor, and control CRE concentration \\nrisk.

Rau \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nAssistant Inspector General for Audits \\n \\nSUBJECT: \\nMaterial Loss Review of First Priority Bank, Bradenton, \\nFlorida (Report No. AUD-09-003) \\n \\n \\nAs required by section 38(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act), the Office \\nof Inspector General (OIG) conducted a material loss1 review of the failure of First \\nPriority Bank (FPB), Bradenton, Florida.   On August 1, 2008, the State of Florida, Office \\nof Financial Regulation (OFR), closed FPB and named the FDIC as receiver.   On \\nAugust 19, 2008, the FDIC notified the OIG that FPB’s total assets at closing were \\n$241 million, and the estimated loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) was \\n$72 million.   \\n \\n When the DIF incurs a material loss with respect to an insured depository institution for \\nwhich the FDIC is appointed receiver, the FDI Act states that the Inspector General of the \\nappropriate federal banking agency shall make a written report to that agency which \\nreviews the agency’s supervision of the institution, including the agency’s \\nimplementation of FDI Act section 38, Prompt Corrective Action (PCA), ascertains why \\nthe institution’s problems resulted in a material loss to the DIF, and makes \\nrecommendations to prevent future losses.   \\n \\nThe audit objectives were to:  (1) determine the causes of the financial institution’s \\nfailure and resulting material loss to the DIF and (2) evaluate the FDIC’s supervision2 of \\nthe institution, including implementation of the PCA provisions of section 38.  \\n Appendix I contains details on our objectives, scope, and methodology; Appendix 2\\n                                                           \\n1 As defined by section 38 of the FDI Act, a loss is material if it exceeds the greater of $25 million or \\n2 percent of an institution’s total assets at the time the FDIC was appointed receiver.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n2 The FDIC’s supervision program promotes the safety and soundness of FDIC-supervised institutions, \\nprotects consumers’ rights, and promotes community investment initiatives by FDIC-supervised insured \\ndepository institutions.  The FDIC’s Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection (DSC) (1) performs \\nexaminations of FDIC-supervised institutions to assess their overall financial condition, management \\npolicies and practices, including internal control systems; and compliance with applicable laws and \\nregulations; and (2) issues related guidance to institutions and examiners.   \\n \\ncontains a glossary of terms.  The FDIC’s response to the draft of this report is contained \\nin Appendix 3.  Acronyms used in the report are listed in Appendix 4.  This report \\npresents the FDIC OIG’s analysis of FPB’s failure and the FDIC’s efforts to require \\nFPB’s management to operate the bank in a safe and sound manner.  The FDIC OIG is \\nperforming similar analyses regarding the failure of other FDIC-supervised financial \\ninstitutions.  A planned capping report will summarize our observations on the major \\ncauses, trends, and common characteristics of failures resulting in a material loss to the \\nDIF.  Recommendations in the capping report will address the FDIC’s supervision of the \\ninstitutions, including implementation of the PCA provisions of section 38. \\n \\n \\nBACKGROUND \\n \\nFPB was a state-chartered nonmember bank, which received approval to open for \\nbusiness on March 27, 2003 subject to certain conditions by the OFR.  The bank was \\ninsured by the FDIC effective December 8, 2003.  FPB, which was headquartered in \\nBradenton, Florida:    \\n \\n• \\nhad a total of five branches in Bradenton, Sarasota, and Venice, Florida; \\n \\n• \\nprovided traditional banking activities within its marketplace;   \\n \\n• \\nspecialized in commercial lending, with concentrations in commercial real \\nestate (CRE), including acquisition, development, and construction (ADC) \\nloans; and \\n \\n• \\nused jumbo certificates of deposit (CD), brokered deposits, Internet deposits, \\nand Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings as funding sources, in \\naddition to core deposits, to fund asset growth.   \\n \\nFPB did not have a holding company, subsidiaries, or affiliates.  FPB’s local marketplace \\nwas, at one time, characterized by rapidly appreciating real estate values.  However, real \\nestate values experienced a significant downturn, causing severe deterioration in FPB’s \\nasset value, excessive operating losses, and severely eroded capital, and the real estate \\nconstruction industry was negatively impacted.   \\n \\nDSC’s Atlanta Regional Office (ARO) and OFR alternated safety and soundness \\nexaminations of FPB, conducting six examinations from June 2004 through May 2008.3  \\n DSC also conducted a visitation concurrently with an OFR examination during June 2004 \\nand another visitation during August 2007.  At the September 2007 examination, FPB’s  \\n                                                           \\n3 The FDIC Report of Examination (ROE) for the May 5, 2008 examination was a draft report and was not \\nofficially issued to FPB.   \\n \\n \\n2\\n \\ncomposite rating was downgraded to 4,4 indicating unsafe and unsound practices or \\nconditions and a distinct possibility of failure if such conditions and practices were not \\nsatisfactorily addressed and resolved.   As a result of the May 2008 examination, FPB’s \\ncomposite rating was downgraded to 5, indicating extremely unsafe and unsound \\npractices or conditions; critically deficient performance, often with inadequate risk \\nmanagement practices; and great supervisory concern.  Institutions in this category pose a \\nsignificant risk to the DIF and have a high probability of failure. \\n \\nFurther, with respect to selected component ratings, as indicated in the figure below, at \\nthe November 2006 examination, FPB’s management rating was downgraded to 3, and \\nasset quality was downgraded to 2.  At the following September 2007 examination, \\nFPB’s asset quality ratings were downgraded to 4.   As a result of the May 2008 \\nexamination, examiners downgraded FPB’s asset quality and liquidity ratings to 5.   \\nFPB's Composite, Management, Asset Quality, and Liquidity Ratings\\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\nRatings (Highest to Lowest)\\n Composite Rating\\n Management Rating\\n Asset Quality Rating\\n Liquidity Rating\\n1 \\n2 \\n3 \\n4 \\n5 \\n \\nJune 04             Dec 04               Nov 05              Nov 06              Sept 07              May 08 \\nSource:  ROEs for FPB. \\n \\n \\n To address examination concerns, including apparent violations of laws and regulations, \\ninadequate risk management controls, and other safety and soundness issues, the OFR \\nand the FDIC jointly issued a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in February 2008, \\nand the FDIC issued a PCA Directive to FPB in June 2008.

Resulting losses severely eroded \\nFPB’s earnings and capital, and negatively impacted liquidity, leading to the bank’s \\nfailure and a material loss to the DIF.  Specifically: \\n \\n \\nManagement.   FPB’s Board of Directors (BOD) did not ensure that bank management \\nidentified, measured, monitored, and controlled the risk of the institution’s activities.   In \\naddition, the BOD did not ensure that corrective actions were implemented in response to \\nexaminer and auditor recommendations.  Although FPB developed a business plan \\ngoverning its activities, the plan was not kept current or followed.  Further, FPB rapidly \\nexpanded branch and lending operations without sufficient attention to associated risk \\nmanagement controls.  Although rapid asset growth, declining asset quality, and poor \\nearnings further increased liquidity risk, bank management did not put into place the \\n \\n \\n4\\n \\nnecessary controls for liquidity management, including an adequate contingency liquidity \\nplan (CLP).5\\n \\n \\nAsset Quality.  FPB’s CRE/ADC loans were concentrated in a rapidly growing local \\nmarketplace.  A significant portion of the loan portfolio included high-risk terms, such as \\nhigh loan-to-value ratios, interest-only with balloon payments, and interest reserves used \\nto capitalize interest expense.   However, FPB did not follow sound loan underwriting \\nstandards and administration practices, including those pertaining to:  (1) effectively \\nidentifying loan portfolio risk; (2) obtaining current appraisals and financial statements \\non borrowers and guarantors; (3) ensuring appropriate use and control over interest \\nreserves; and (4) providing appropriate reports to the BOD on loan concentrations, \\nspeculative lending, and interest reserves.   Also, FPB did not maintain a sufficient \\nallowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL).  As asset quality declined and losses were \\nrecognized, FPB’s liquidity position became critical, and earnings and capital were \\neroded.   \\n \\n \\n Supervision.  The FDIC and OFR conducted timely examinations of FPB.  Additionally, \\nthe FDIC provided oversight through its off-site monitoring process and accelerated \\nexaminations as a result of identified deficiencies.   As a result of the November 2006 \\nexamination, the FDIC delayed its approval of three FPB branch applications until FPB \\nprovided information on how the bank would address those examination concerns.  As a \\nresult of the September 2007 examination, and after various discussions between OFR \\nand FPB regarding the bank’s condition and proposed regulatory actions, the FDIC, in \\nconjunction with the OFR, took supervisory action in February 2008 to address \\nmanagement’s failure to implement corrective actions in response to audit and examiner \\nconcerns.  Such concerns included, but were not limited to, inadequate management \\noversight, poor asset quality, the need to increase capital and improve earnings, an \\ninadequate ALLL, noncompliance with laws and regulations, and an outdated liquidity \\npolicy.   Further, in March and May 2008, the FDIC notified FPB of applicable \\nrestrictions under PCA when FPB fell below the well capitalized category, and in June \\n2008, the FDIC issued a PCA Directive.  The FDIC has authority to take a wide range of \\nsupervisory actions.  In the case of FPB, however, supervisory actions were not always \\ntimely and effective in addressing the bank’s most significant problems.   \\n \\nThe FDIC has taken steps to improve its supervisory review of business plans, oversight \\nof financial institutions that have CRE loan concentrations and use interest reserves, and \\nCLPs.  However, FPB’s loan documentation and administration deficiencies should have \\nwarranted greater concern as a result of the 2006 examination.  Specifically, during that \\nexamination, FPB was in a de novo6 status; the loan portfolio had begun to deteriorate \\nand was highly concentrated in high-risk ADC loans; loan administration issues, \\nidentified as early as the FDIC’s 2004 examination, were uncorrected or in need of \\n                                                           \\n5 DSC uses the terms contingency liquidity plan, liquidity contingency plans, and contingency funding \\nplans interchangeably.  For purposes of this report, we use the term contingency liquidity plans.   \\n6 De novo institutions are subject to additional supervisory oversight and regulatory controls, including the \\ndevelopment and maintenance of a current business plan and increased examination frequency.   \\n \\n \\n 5\\n \\n \\n \\n 6\\n                                                          \\nimprovement; ALLL was inadequate; and FPB’s risk profile was increasing.  Greater \\nconcern regarding FPB’s loan documentation and administration deficiencies could have \\nled to elevated supervisory attention and earlier supervisory action.   \\n \\n \\nMANAGEMENT \\n \\nExaminations in 2004 and 2005 resulted in a 2 rating for FPB management.  At \\nsubsequent examinations, the rating was progressively downgraded, indicating deficient \\nBOD and management performance, risk management practices that were inadequate, \\nand excessive risk exposure.  By 2006, the bank’s problems and significant risks had \\nbeen inadequately identified, measured, monitored, or controlled and required immediate \\naction by FPB’s BOD and management to preserve the safety and soundness of the \\ninstitution.  In addition, FPB rapidly expanded the bank’s branch operations without \\nregard to loan documentation and administration deficiencies and the inadequacy of other \\nrisk management controls.   \\n \\n \\nIneffective BOD and Management \\n \\nExaminer concerns with FPB’s BOD and management were noted at the bank’s \\nexaminations conducted in 2004 and 2005, including concerns related to excessive \\ngrowth; noncompliance with laws and regulations and the OFR and FDIC final orders \\nregarding the bank’s charter and deposit insurance approval; and FPB’s business plan.7  \\nMany of those issues continued throughout the bank’s existence.   FPB examinations \\nshowed a continuing pattern of inadequate risk management for the loan portfolio, \\nbeginning with the first examination in June 2004; growing severity regarding the lack of \\nloan documentation; inadequate loan administration; and significant loan portfolio \\ndeterioration, culminating in an increasing risk profile for the institution.   The loan \\ndocumentation and administration deficiencies were repeated and compounded as noted \\nin the 2005 through 2008 examinations. Table 2, which follows, provides examples of \\nexaminer comments and recommendations related to FPB’s BOD and management.  \\n \\n 7 The FDIC’s amended order granting deposit insurance required that FPB operate within the parameters of \\nthe bank’s business plan submitted to the FDIC and that FPB notify DSC’s Regional Director of proposed \\nmajor deviations or material changes 60 days before consummation of the change.   \\nTable 2:  Examples of Examiner Comments and Recommendations Regarding FPB’s BOD and Management Performance \\nExamination and Visitation Dates \\nExaminer Comments

2007 examination and identified substantial deterioration in FPB’s condition. \\n \\n \\nRisk Management.   FPB did not ensure that adequate risk management controls were \\nimplemented and followed and did not implement corrective actions in a timely manner \\nto adequately address deficiencies identified by examiners and auditors related to the \\nbank’s inadequate risk management controls for loan documentation, administration, and \\nmonitoring.   \\n \\n FPB’s loan policy stated that the bank would avoid concentrations of credit, defined as \\nloans or certain groups of loans which, when aggregated, exceeded 25 percent of the \\nbank’s equity capital and reserves, including combinations of loans secured by types of \\ncollateral that were particularly vulnerable to volatile market conditions.  However, in \\ncontravention of this policy, FPB’s BOD and senior management focused on a strategy of \\naggressively growing the bank’s assets, consisting primarily of high-risk CRE loans with \\na heavy concentration in ADC loans.  As early as the December 2004 examination, FPB’s \\nCRE loans totaled nearly 65 percent of the loan portfolio.  Total assets from June 2004 \\nthrough June 2008 grew, on a cumulative basis, over 516 percent from $41 million to \\nover $258 million, with the majority of the growth occurring in 2004 through 2006—\\nduring FPB’s de novo period.  However, given such growth and an increased risk profile \\nthat resulted from FPB’s BOD and management’s decision to pursue such lending \\nactivity, the bank did not adequately identify, measure, monitor, and report regularly to \\nthe BOD on these concentrations, speculative lending, and interest reserves.   \\n \\nThe September 2007 ROE noted that while FPB had made some improvement, the bank’s \\noverall portfolio risk identification, measuring, monitoring, and reporting practices were \\nineffective.  In fact, inadequate loan documentation and administration were also \\nidentified and reported by examiners in the bank’s last examination report dated May \\n2008.  Specifically, the FDIC’s May 2008 examination concluded that during FPB’s brief \\nhistory, the bank had operated with an aggressive loan growth strategy that included \\npoorly structured and underwritten real-estate-dependent loans in a highly competitive \\nmarket.  The decline in real estate values and construction activity had resulted in many \\nprojects being delayed or abandoned.  Nevertheless, because the bank’s risk management \\nand loan administration practices were inadequate, the BOD was slow to recognize the \\nincreasing risk in FPB’s loan portfolio and lending program as residential real estate \\nvalues started to decline.   \\n \\n \\nInadequate Actions for Apparent Violations of Regulatory Requirements.  \\n Beginning with the bank’s June 2004 examination, examiners cited FPB for apparent \\nviolations of laws and regulations related to loans to directors and officers, appraisals, \\nand minimum capital requirements; contraventions of interagency policies on supervisory \\nloan-to-value limits and ALLL; and noncompliance with regulatory orders.  According to \\nthe DSC Risk Management Manual of Examination Policies (Examination Manual), an \\ninstitution’s BOD and management should implement appropriate policies and \\nprocedures to effect compliance, detect instances of noncompliance, institute corrective \\nmeasures, and provide adequate training and retraining of officers and employees to \\nprevent future infractions.  Further, the Examination Manual states that it is important \\n \\n \\n9 \\n \\nthat the correction of all apparent violations of laws and regulations be instituted \\npromptly, regardless of their perceived importance.   \\n \\nWith respect to the regulatory orders, FPB did not comply with specific conditions \\nincluded in the following: \\n \\n• The FDIC’s Final Order of Approval for Deposit Insurance related to significantly \\ndeviating from the bank’s business plan by exceeding loan growth projections \\nduring the first year of operation without prior notification to the FDIC. \\n \\n• OFR Final Order related to (1) notifying the OFR of FPB’s proposed employment \\nof individuals as executive officers or equivalent positions, (2) providing copies of \\nemployment agreements or contracts, and (3) submitting a revised business plan \\nand financial projections to OFR within the first 6 months of FPB’s operations.   \\n \\nFPB’s BOD and management failed to implement adequate controls to ensure \\ncompliance with laws, regulations, and other regulatory requirements, even though \\napparent violations were reported in each of the bank’s six examinations.   \\n \\n \\nDeviations from FPB’s Business Plan.  Contrary to the FDIC’s final order approving \\nFPB’s deposit insurance, FPB significantly deviated from its business plan by quickly \\nexceeding financial projections and budgets and realizing net losses during its de novo \\nperiod that were significantly higher than planned losses.   In addition, FPB disregarded \\nloan documentation and administration controls that were outlined in its business plan.  \\nFurther, the bank’s business plan indicated that the bank planned to make commercial, \\nresidential, and construction loans, including real estate acquisitions and improvements; \\nhowever, the plan did not provide information regarding FPB’s intentions to concentrate \\nits loan operations in CRE/ADC loans, which can present high risks for institutions, and \\nrapidly expand by opening five branch offices.  FPB also did not follow certain risk \\nmanagement controls outlined in its business plan that impacted its lending policy and \\npractices.   \\n \\nProposed financial institutions are expected to submit business plans with their initial \\napplications for federal deposit insurance.  According to the FDIC Statement of Policy on \\nApplications for Deposit Insurance, and in compliance with sections 5 and 6 of the \\nFDI Act, the FDIC must be assured that the proposed institution does not present an \\nundue risk to the DIF.  The FDIC expects that proposed institutions will submit a \\nbusiness plan commensurate with the capabilities of its management and the financial \\ncommitment of the incorporators.  Any significant deviation from the business plan \\nwithin the first 3 years of operation—the de novo phase—must be reported by the insured \\ndepository institution to the primary federal regulator before consummation of the \\nchange.  Business plans that rely on high-risk lending, a special-purpose market, or \\nsignificant funding from sources other than core deposits, or that otherwise diverge from \\nconventional bank-related financial services, require specific documentation as to the \\nsuitability of the proposed activities for an insured institution.  Similarly, additional \\n \\n \\n10 \\n \\ndocumentation of a business plan is required where markets to be entered are intensely \\ncompetitive or economic conditions are marginal.  Business plans also include \\ninformation on projected financial data for a 3-year period.   \\n \\nSoon after FPB’s opening, examiners concluded that the bank had significantly deviated \\nfrom its business plan and initial financial projections, and FPB’s asset growth had \\nquickly exceeded the revised October 2003 projections.   FPB’s July 2004 revised \\nbusiness plan and financial projections reflected the significant deviations which \\nincluded, but were not limited to (1) increased asset growth, (2) expanding branch office \\noperations, and (3) an additional capital infusion.   In addition, FPB did not follow risk \\nmanagement controls outlined in the bank’s business plan related to its loan portfolio (see \\nTable 3 for examples). \\n \\nTable 3:  FPB’s Business Plan Compared to FPB’s Actions \\nFPB’s Business Plan \\nFPB’s Actions \\nFollow a conservative lending policy that permitted \\nprudent risks.   \\nFPB pursued a liberal lending strategy and relaxed \\nunderwriting practices that included aggressively growing the \\nbank’s CRE/ADC loan portfolio and expanding branch \\noperations. \\n \\n Commit funds to asset products with low loan risk.   \\n \\nFPB aggressively pursued high-risk CRE/ADC loans that \\nsignificantly increased the bank’s risk exposure and ALLL and \\nnegatively impacted earnings and capital.  \\n \\nExercise care and good judgment in underwriting \\nloans (including underwriting loans on the basis of \\nthe borrower’s ability to repay the loan from the cash \\nflow of the business, obtaining appraisals at the time \\nloans are originated, maintaining an adequate ALLL, \\nand limiting the level of classified assets to less than \\n1 percent of the assets).   \\nFPB’s BOD and management failed to ensure that appropriate \\nloan documentation and administration risk management \\ncontrols were implemented and followed, took actions that \\nnegatively affected the quality of the bank’s assets, failed to \\nmaintain an adequate ALLL, and allowed adversely classified \\nassets to exceed 400 percent of total capital prior to failure.   \\n \\n Source:  FPB’s business plan, ROEs, and OIG analysis.  \\n \\n \\nFPB Branch Offices.  FPB’s original business plan was conservative; however, the bank \\nsoon departed from its plan and embarked on an aggressive growth/branching strategy.  \\nOf particular note is the bank’s decision to rapidly expand branch operations.   As \\nindicated in Table 4, applications for three FPB branch offices were submitted, accepted, \\nand approved by the FDIC after its November 2006 examination began, during which \\nsignificant examiner concerns regarding the bank’s compliance with laws and \\nregulations, loan administration and documentation, CRE/ADC concentration, inadequate \\nALLL, inadequate BOD and management performance, deviations from the banks \\nbusiness plan, and weak earnings were reported.   \\n \\n \\n11 \\n \\nTable 4:  FPB Application History and Examiner Concerns \\nApplication Status \\n \\n \\nFPB Branch \\nSubmitted \\nAccepted \\nApproved \\nBranch \\nOffice \\nOpened \\n \\n \\nSignificant Examination Concerns \\n1 \\n8/4/2004 \\n8/20/2004 \\n8/30/2004 \\n2/23/2006 \\nViolations of laws and regulations.   \\nLoan administration and \\ndocumentation deficiencies.  \\nEarnings were weak and resulted in a \\nnet loss.   \\n \\n2 \\n 10/4/2005 \\n10/6/2005 \\n11/4/2005 \\n7/5/2006 \\nViolations of laws and regulations.   \\nLoan administration and \\ndocumentation deficiencies.   \\nExaminers downgraded liquidity. \\n \\n \\n3 \\n12/27/2006 \\n2/1/2007 \\n3/16/2007 \\n4/30/2007 \\n4 \\n12/27/2006 \\n2/1/2007 \\n3/16/2007 \\n5/21/2007 \\n5 \\n3/20/2007 \\n5/3/2007 \\n6/4/2007 \\n7/16/2007 \\nViolations of laws and regulations.   \\n \\nSignificant loan documentation and \\nadministration deficiencies. \\n \\n Decline in FPB’s asset quality, with \\nnoticeable loan portfolio deterioration. \\n \\nFPB’s rapid growth not adequately \\nmonitored or managed by the BOD \\nand management, and the BOD and \\nmanagement needed to improve \\nperformance.   \\n \\n \\n Source:  An FDIC Supervisory History memorandum and ROEs for FPB. \\n \\n \\n During the November 2006 examination, the examiner noted that aggressive branching \\nplans underscored the need to significantly improve the loan review and administration \\nfunctions.   Further, during the examination, the bank’s chief loan officer resigned, \\ncreating additional loan monitoring challenges.  Within its short existence, FPB opened \\nfive branch offices and three loan production offices (LPO) without adequate \\nconsideration of examiner concerns regarding the bank’s loan documentation and \\nadministration and other risk management control weaknesses and inadequate monitoring \\nand management of the bank’s growth.  In addition, FPB’s additional branch offices \\nincreased the bank’s overhead costs; placed additional strain on earnings, which had been \\nhistorically weak; and contributed to the bank’s increasing reliance on non-core deposits \\nto fund its asset growth.   \\n \\n \\nLack of a Comprehensive CLP.  FPB did not implement sound liquidity risk \\nmanagement controls that included a comprehensive CLP.  As a result, when FPB’s \\nasset quality severely deteriorated, the bank’s liquidity position was impacted by \\nnegative publicity related to the bank’s financial condition.  According to the \\n \\n \\n12 \\n \\nExamination Manual, CLPs should be in force and should include strategies for handling \\nliquidity crises and procedures for addressing cash flow shortfalls in emergency \\nsituations.  The manual also states that financial institutions should have an adequate \\nCLP in place to manage and monitor liquidity risk, ensure that an appropriate amount of \\nliquid assets is maintained, measure and project funding requirements during various \\nscenarios, and manage access to funding sources.   \\n \\n FPB demonstrated warning indicators that should have prompted FPB of the need for a \\ncomprehensive CLP and increased monitoring of the bank’s liquidity position by the \\nbank’s BOD and management.   For example, FPB exhibited indicators such as: \\n \\n• \\nrapid asset growth funded,  \\n• \\na decline in earnings performance or projections, \\n• \\na decline in asset quality, and  \\n• \\nreal or perceived negative publicity. \\n \\nThe FDIC issued Financial Institution Letter—FIL-59-2003—entitled, Use of the \\nFederal Reserve’s Primary Credit Program in Effective Liquidity Management, dated \\nJuly 23, 2003, which provides interagency guidance on the need for financial institutions \\nto develop CLPs, in addition to other liquidity risk management controls, and informs \\ndepository institutions that a contingency plan should be part of the bank’s liquidity \\nmanagement program.   In addition, the Examination Manual includes 13 suggested \\nelements that should be included in CLPs.  However, FPB’s CLP included only 3 of \\nthose 13 elements.   FPB’s CLP identified sources of funding but did not identify the \\nconditions related to their use and circumstances where the institution might use them.  \\n For example, the CLP did not: \\n \\n• \\ndefine responsibilities and decision-making authority,  \\n• \\ninclude an assessment of the possible liquidity events that an institution might \\nencounter, \\n• \\ndetail how management would monitor for liquidity events, and  \\n• \\nidentify and assess the adequacy of contingent funding sources.   \\n \\n Further, FPB’s CLP was not diversified to allow consideration of potential providers of \\nfunds and the underlying stability, availability, and flexibility of funding sources.   \\n \\nFPB’s BOD and management had failed to implement adequate controls to monitor the \\nbank’s liquidity risk.  The September 2007 examination identified significant \\ndeterioration in FPB’s loan portfolio, a high level of adverse classifications, significant \\ndowngrades in loans from the bank’s internal watch list, and an inadequate ALLL.   After \\nOctober 2007, FPB’s asset liability committee failed to monitor, strategize, and \\notherwise plan for FPB’s liquidity needs, even though the bank’s financial condition was \\nseverely deteriorating.   \\n \\n \\n \\n13 \\n \\nFPB’s loan portfolio deterioration became even more critical after the bank’s September \\n2007 examination, which identified significant deterioration in FPB’s asset quality. \\nFPB’s liquidity position was monitored solely by the chief financial officer, who \\nmanaged the bank’s liquidity by focusing almost exclusively on maintaining sufficient \\nliquidity to avert a crisis.  As FPB’s financial position continued to deteriorate due to \\npoor asset quality, the bank’s liquidity position was adversely affected.  Specifically, \\nFPB’s net interest margin declined, and earnings and capital positions were adversely \\naffected.  In addition, FPB was required to pledge investment securities to secure the \\nbank’s lines of credit.  Further, the bank lacked adequate controls and potential sources \\nto address liquidity shortfalls and the resultant crises, and negative publicity impacted \\nthe bank’s liquidity position.   \\n \\n \\nRegulatory Supervision Related to Management \\n \\n According to the Examination Manual, the quality of management is probably the single \\nmost important element in the successful operation of a bank.  The BOD is responsible \\nfor formulating sound policies and objectives for the bank, effective supervision of its \\naffairs, and promotion of its welfare, while the primary responsibility of senior \\nmanagement is implementing the BOD’s policies and objectives in the bank’s day-to-day \\noperations.  Also according to the manual, the capability and performance of \\nmanagement and the BOD is rated based upon, but not limited to, an assessment of \\ncompliance with laws and regulations.   \\n \\nGenerally, FPB provided written responses to each examination and promised corrective \\nactions, and examiners generally followed up on any recommendations at the next \\nexamination.  However, in response to the 2006 examination, the FDIC followed up with \\nFPB between examinations, requiring FPB to provide information on addressing the 2006 \\nexamination loan administration and documentation issues and improving earnings (both \\nmanagement and earnings were rated 3 at the 2006 examination).   In its response to the \\nFDIC on January 29, 2007, FPB stated it had taken steps to hire new management, \\nincluding a chief credit officer and commercial loan portfolio manager; increased the loan \\ndepartment staff; and initiated actions to improve loan administration.  Although the \\nFDIC accepted FPB’s response, FPB failed to implement actions to sufficiently address \\nthe 2006 examination results and to prevent the continued deterioration of FPB’s \\nfinancial condition.   \\n \\n In addition, according to the DSC Case Manager Procedures Manual, the risk posed by \\nany particular institution is a function of the business plan pursued, management’s \\ncompetency in administering the institution’s affairs, and the quality and implementation \\nof risk management programs.  Regarding FPB’s business plan, examiner concerns \\nseemed to focus on the bank’s financial projections and did not include an assessment of \\nFPB’s planned business strategy and risk management controls compared to the bank’s \\nactual practices.  Although DSC required FPB to provide updated financial and budget \\ndata, DSC did not require FPB to provide a revised business plan that addressed the \\nbank’s concentrations in CRE/ADC loans that presented high risks to the bank and the \\n \\n \\n14 \\n \\nbank’s plan to mitigate such risk through appropriate loan documentation, administration, \\nand lending strategies.   \\n \\nRegarding FPB’s branch office activities, examiners downgraded FPB’s management and \\nearnings ratings from 2 to 3 and downgraded asset quality from 1 to 2 as a result of the \\n2006 examination.  According to the DSC Case Manager Procedures Manual, an \\napplication can be removed from expedited processing if DSC determines that the bank’s \\napplication presents significant supervisory concerns, including a management rating \\nof 3.  Accordingly, after the November 2006 examination, the FDIC removed three FPB \\nbranch applications (for FPB’s third, fourth, and fifth branch offices) from the expedited \\napproval process because the BOD and management had not: \\n \\n• \\nstaffed loan operations and review properly while focusing on rapid growth, \\nwhich had resulted in numerous administrative deficiencies and inadequate \\nportfolio monitoring systems; \\n \\n• \\nadequately funded the ALLL; \\n \\n• \\nprovided sufficient internal audit oversight; and \\n \\n• \\nimplemented examiner recommendations in a timely manner.   \\n \\nThe FDIC’s decision-making process for FPB’s branch applications included an \\nassessment of FPB’s financial data and branching strategy.  In addition, pursuant to \\nsections 5 and 6 of the FDI Act, DSC officials evaluated FPB’s applications for branch \\noffices to conclude on the: \\n \\n• \\nfinancial history and condition of FPB, \\n• \\nadequacy of FPB’s capital structure, \\n• \\nfuture earnings prospects, \\n• \\ngeneral character and fitness of bank management, \\n• \\nrisk to the DIF, and  \\n• \\nconvenience and needs of the community to be served.   \\n \\n DSC officials also evaluated the applications to determine whether FPB’s corporate \\npowers were consistent with the purposes of the FDI Act. \\n \\nBefore the FDIC approved FPB’s applications for its third and fourth branch offices, the \\nFDIC proactively required FPB to respond to the November 2006 examination \\ndeficiencies, submit revised financial projections reflecting the proposed branches, and \\ndiscuss the bank’s earnings improvement plan.   In its response, FPB projected net income \\nof $263,000, which DSC considered realistic.   In addition, FPB stated that in August \\n2006, FPB had hired a chief credit officer, who was expected to have a positive impact on \\ncredit administration and portfolio monitoring systems, and hired a new senior lender in \\nDecember 2006.  Additionally, the BOD stated its commitment to correct the weaknesses \\nnoted in the ROE and provided corrective action plans to address the weaknesses.   \\n \\n \\n \\n15 \\n \\nRegarding FPB’s application for its fifth branch office, the FDIC requested FPB to \\nprovide a copy of the bank’s strategic/business plans for 2007 and 2008, including \\nassumptions and branching plans; supporting assumptions for the 2007 budget; and \\ncopies of CRE loan concentration reports provided to the BOD.  The FDIC reviewed \\nFPB’s revised financial projections, which included the three branches in 2007 and a \\nconservatively maintained ALLL throughout the 2-year period and reflected a nominal \\nloss of $28,000 in 2007 and net income of $693,000 in 2008.  However, from the time \\nFPB responded to the FDIC’s concerns related to the third and fourth branch offices to its \\nresponse for the fifth branch, the bank’s net income projections for 2007 had changed \\nfrom $263,000 to a projected net loss of $28,000—a decrease of $291,000.   \\n \\n Nevertheless, the FDIC concluded that: \\n \\n• \\nFPB’s business plan anticipated that future earnings opportunities would be \\nenhanced by accessing new markets and lowering its cost of funds with new retail \\ndeposits generated by the branches;  \\n \\n• \\nthe bank’s CRE loan report reflected improved monitoring; and  \\n \\n• \\nFPB’s capital was sufficient to support the business plan with projected Tier 1 \\nLeverage Capital Ratios of 10.3 percent at the end of 2007 and 8.4 percent at the \\nend of 2008.  \\n \\nAdditionally, FPB committed to the FDIC that it had no additional branching plans \\nthrough 2008.  However, soon after FPB’s last branch office opened on July 16, 2007, the \\nFDIC’s offsite analysis and follow-up visitation conducted in July and August 2007, \\nrespectively, identified significant deterioration in FPB’s financial condition, earnings, \\nand asset quality; and loan documentation and administration deficiencies, indicating \\nineffective corrective actions to address prior examiner concerns and FPB’s deficient risk \\nmanagement controls.  Further, the FDIC assessed FPB’s branch applications based on \\nstatutory requirements and delayed application approvals; however, the actions taken and \\npromised by FPB ultimately did not resolve examiner concerns, overall operational \\ndeficiencies, or earnings performance issues (see Table 2).   \\n \\nPrevious guidance related to business plans did not provide a definition of significant \\ndeviations; accordingly, in June 2008, DSC’s ARO issued guidance for determining what \\nconstitutes a major deviation or material change in business plans for de novo institutions \\nduring the first 3 years of operation.  That guidance states that examiners should consider \\nwhether changes have occurred in growth levels, asset and liability mix or products \\noffered, and plans for branch offices or LPOs.   \\n \\nAlthough FPB had not developed a comprehensive CLP, examiners did not recommend \\nthat the bank review and revise its CLP to adequately address the 13 plan elements listed \\nin the Examination Manual.  FPB had not developed controls that could have identified \\nthe specific circumstances under which secondary sources of funds should be used and \\nthe manner in which those funds would be used to provide liquidity for the bank.   \\n \\n \\n \\n16 \\n \\nSubsequent to FPB’s failure, DSC issued additional guidance related to liquidity risk and \\nCLPs.  The FDIC’s Liquidity Risk Management guidance, dated August 26, 2008, urges \\nthe financial institution BOD to establish a formal CLP that establishes quantitative \\nliquidity risk guidelines.  The guidance also states that CLPs should identify the \\ninstitution’s liquidity risk profile and the types of stress events that may be faced \\nincluding, but not limited to, a deterioration in asset quality, becoming less than well \\ncapitalized, the need to fund unplanned asset growth, loss of access to market funding \\nsources, and the impact of negative press coverage.  The guidance also reiterates many of \\nthe CLP elements that FPB’s CLP did not include, as discussed earlier.   \\n \\n \\nASSET QUALITY \\n \\nFPB’s asset quality was rated 1 at its 2004 and 2005 examinations.  At subsequent \\nexaminations, FPB’s asset quality rating was progressively downgraded, indicating that \\nthe bank’s level of risk and problem assets were significant and inadequately controlled \\nand subjected the bank to potential losses that threatened the viability of the institution.  \\nBy the May 2008 examination, examiners concluded that FPB’s asset quality or credit \\nadministration practices were critically deficient and presented an imminent threat to the \\ninstitution’s viability.   \\n \\nFPB’s asset quality deteriorated as total adversely classified items increased to over \\n$65.7 million in 2008.  In particular, loan classifications significantly increased, from \\n$5.7 million in 2006 to over $60.1 million in 2008.  Corresponding increases in the FPB’s \\nadversely classified loans and ALLL were also significant (see Table 5).   At the \\nNovember 2006 examination, adversely classified loans represented 15.66 percent of \\ncapital, and by May 2008, adversely classified loans totaled more than 403 percent of \\ncapital.   \\n \\nTable 5:  FPB Asset Classifications and ALLL \\n \\nAsset Quality \\n(Dollars in Thousands) \\nAsset Classifications \\nAnalysis of ALLL \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nExamination \\nDate \\n \\n \\n \\nSubstandard \\n \\n \\n \\nDoubtful \\n \\n \\n \\nLoss \\n \\nTotal \\nClassified \\nItems \\n \\nALLL \\nComputed by \\nFPB \\nIncrease in \\nALLL  \\nRequired by \\nExaminers \\n \\nJune 04 \\n0 \\n0 \\n0 \\n0 \\n$80 \\n0 \\nDec 04 \\n0 \\n0 \\n0 \\n0 \\n$398 \\n0 \\nNov 05 \\n0 \\n0 \\n0 \\n0 \\n$1,201 \\n0 \\nNov 06 \\n$4,649 \\n$25 \\n$1,061 \\n$5,735 \\n$2,640 \\n$1,100 \\nSept 07 \\n$41,474 \\n0 \\n$3,232 \\n$44,706 \\n$3,606 \\n$6,100 \\nMay 08 \\n$58,240 \\n$392 \\n$7,086 \\n$65,718 \\n$8,468 \\n$3,400 \\nSource:  ROEs for FPB.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n17 \\n \\n In addition to identification of the $5.7 million in adversely classified assets at the 2006 \\nexamination, examiners identified another $4.6 million in assets as “Special Mention,” \\nreferring to loans that had potential weaknesses that deserved management’s close \\nattention and, if left uncorrected, could result in deterioration of the status of those assets. \\n \\n \\nExaminer Concerns and Recommendations Regarding Asset Quality \\n \\nExaminer concerns regarding FPB’s asset quality related to its concentration in high-risk \\nCRE/ADC loans and the bank’s lack of adequate loan documentation and administration \\n(see Table 6, which follows).  A significant portion of the CRE/ADC loan portfolio \\nincluded high-risk terms, such as high loan-to-value ratios, an interest-only basis with \\nballoon payments, and interest reserves used to capitalize interest expense.   \\n \\n \\n \\n 18 \\n \\nTable 6:  Examples of Examiner Comments and Recommendations Regarding FPB’s \\nAsset Quality \\nExamination Dates \\nExaminer Comments*  \\nJune \\n2004 \\nDec \\n2004 \\nNov \\n2005 \\nNov \\n2006 \\nSept \\n2007 \\nMay \\n2008 \\nOverall conclusion on FPB asset quality  \\n• Strong or satisfactory \\n9 \\n9 \\n9 \\n9 \\n \\n \\n• BOD and management were slow to identify and manage problem \\nloans \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n9 \\n9 \\nCRE and ADC concentrations \\n• Concentration developing or already developed \\n \\n9 \\n9 \\n9 \\n9 \\n9 \\n• Increasing risk profile based on loan portfolio affected by an \\neconomic downturn \\n \\n \\n \\n9 \\n9 \\n9 \\nAdverse classifications \\n• Noticeable loan quality deterioration and significant increases in \\nadverse classifications and ALLL \\n \\n \\n \\n9 \\n9 \\n9 \\nAssessment of risk management practices \\n• Risk management, monitoring, and reporting practices ineffective \\nor inadequate \\n \\n \\n \\n9 \\n9 \\n \\n• Loan documentation and/or underwriting standards needed \\nimprovement \\n9 \\n9 \\n9 \\n9 \\n9 \\n9 \\n• ALLL methodology adequate \\n \\n \\n \\n9 \\n \\n \\n• ALLL methodology inadequate \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n9 \\n9 \\n• ALLL adequately funded  \\n \\n9 \\n9 \\n \\n \\n \\n• ALLL not adequately funded \\n \\n \\n \\n9 \\n9 \\n9 \\n• Inadequate attention to examiner and auditor recommendations \\n \\n \\n \\n9 \\n9 \\n9 \\n• Loan policy lacking specific parameters for limiting concentrations \\nand promoting portfolio diversity \\n \\n \\n \\n9 \\n9 \\n \\n• Inaccurate internal watch list that did not include all adversely \\nclassified loans  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n9 \\n \\nExaminer recommendations \\n• Document the review of appraisals and/or include appraisal reports \\nin loan files  \\n9 \\n \\n \\n9 \\n9 \\n9 \\n• Provide comprehensive reports on loan concentration by collateral \\ntype, industries, or geographic boundaries or establish \\nconcentration limits  \\n9 \\n \\n \\n9 \\n9 \\n \\n• Document and/or improve the ALLL methodology and allowance  \\n9 \\n \\n \\n9 \\n9 \\n9 \\n• Improve internal reporting on interest reserves, speculative \\nlending, and loans exceeding supervisory loan-to-value guidelines  \\n \\n \\n \\n9 \\n9 \\n \\n• Ensure real estate loans in excess of the supervisory loan-to-value \\nlimits do not exceed total capital \\n \\n9 \\n \\n9 \\n9 \\n9 \\nSource:  ROEs for FPB.   \\n* Refer to Table 2 for additional examples of examiner comments and recommendations related to FPB’s asset \\nquality, including those for the FDIC’s August 2007 visitation.   \\n \\n \\n 19 \\n \\n Concentration in CRE and ADC Loans \\n \\nFPB’s concentration in CRE loans was first noted during the FDIC’s December 2004 \\nexamination when those loans comprised 65 percent of the loan portfolio.  DSC ROEs \\nand examination work papers documented that steady and rapid increases in CRE-related \\nexposure followed as indicated below.   \\n \\n • \\nMarch 2005.  CRE loans totaled more than 228 percent of Tier 1 capital. \\n \\n • \\nSeptember 2006.  CRE exposure totaled 127 percent of Tier 1 Leverage Capital.  \\nIncluding multi-family and other non-farm nonresidential loans increased the \\nbank’s risk exposure to 342 percent of Tier 1 Leverage Capital.  Further, \\nexaminers noted that the degree of exposure was likely underreported because the \\nbank recognized that an undetermined amount of loans might need to be \\nreclassified as CRE loans.  \\n \\n • \\nJune 2007.  CRE loans represented 388 percent of total capital.  Of that amount, \\nADC loans comprised 49 percent of all CRE loans and were equal to 190 percent \\nof total capital—nearly double the benchmark for further supervisory review.  \\nClassified assets were 129 percent of Tier 1 Capital and the ALLL, which was \\ndeficient by $6.1 million.   Additionally, loans totaling a substantial $15.2 million \\nwere downgraded and adversely classified, and loans totaling an additional \\n$9 million were not on FPB’s internal watch list.  \\n \\n • \\nMay 2008.  The level of concentration was extremely high given the fact that the \\nbank was critically undercapitalized and the amount of CRE loans was significant.   \\n \\n On December 12, 2006, the federal banking agencies issued joint guidance on CRE \\nlending entitled, Guidance on Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound \\nRisk Management Practices.  According to the guidance, the FDIC and the other federal \\nbanking agencies acknowledged that a concentration in CRE loans, coupled with weak \\nloan underwriting and depressed CRE markets, has contributed to significant loan \\nlosses.8   \\n \\nHowever, FPB focused and concentrated its loan portfolio in CRE/ADC loans, which \\nincreased its level of risk, and failed to ensure that adequate risk management controls \\nwere developed and implemented.  Examiners recommended several actions to mitigate \\nthe bank’s CRE risk.  However, bank management failed to implement actions to \\nadequately address those recommendations, and asset quality continued to decline.  \\n Further, beginning with the November 2006 examination, and continuing through the \\nMay 2008 examination, examiners identified a high level of adverse classifications along \\nwith significant downgrades of classified loans, an inadequate ALLL methodology, and \\n                                                           \\n8 The FDIC also issued FIL 22-2008 on March 17, 2008, entitled, Managing Commercial Real Estate \\nConcentrations in a Challenging Environment, which re-emphasized the importance of strong capital and \\nALLL and loan risk-management practices for state nonmember institutions with significant CRE and \\nconstruction and development loan concentrations.   \\n \\n \\n 20 \\n \\ninadequately funded ALLL.  As asset quality declined and losses were properly \\nrecognized, FPB’s liquidity position became deficient, and earnings and capital were \\neroded.   \\n \\n \\n Interest Reserves.  FPB did not have appropriate controls related to the use and \\nreporting of interest reserves.  FPB’s December 8, 2003 loan policy stated the bank \\nshould include provisions in the loan agreement that provide for the discontinuation of \\nfunding of the interest reserve in the event the project falls behind projected performance \\ngoals.  However, FPB did not always follow this policy in that management extended or \\nre-funded the interest reserves for many loans.  In addition, FPB did not maintain \\ncomplete records on the extent and number of loans funded with interest reserves or the \\nextent of loans for which interest reserves had been funded multiple times.  Through \\nreconstruction of FPB records, the OIG determined that FPB used about $8.9 million in \\ninterest reserves to fund loans.  Of that amount, $4.5 million (about 51 percent) was \\nassociated with FPB’s adversely classified loans.  The use of interest reserves helped to \\nmask the deterioration of these loans.   \\n \\nDSC has issued guidance on the use of interest reserves.  In November 2007, the ARO \\nissued guidance entitled, Identification and Analysis of Interest Reserves at Risk \\nManagement Examinations.   In April 2008, DSC issued examiner guidance reiterating \\nthe November 2007 ARO guidance.  In addition, in June 2008, DSC issued guidance to \\nexaminers and FDIC-supervised financial institutions on the use of interest reserves that \\ndescribes the use of interest reserves in ADC lending, examines the risk this underwriting \\npractice could present, and identifies “red flags” that should alert lenders to potential \\nproblems at each stage of the ADC cycle.   \\n \\n \\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses.  FPB’s methodology for determining the ALLL \\ndid not comply with interagency policy.  According to the Interagency Policy Statement \\non the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (FIL-105-2006), dated December 13, 2006, \\neach institution must analyze the collectibility of its loans and maintain an ALLL at a \\nlevel that is appropriate and determined to be in accordance with Generally Accepted \\nAccounting Principles (GAAP).9  An appropriate ALLL covers estimated loan losses on \\nindividually evaluated loans that are determined to be impaired as well as estimated loan \\nlosses inherent in the remainder of the loan and lease portfolio.   \\n \\n                                                           \\n9 Interagency Policy Statement on the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (FIL-105-2006), dated \\nDecember 13, 2006.  The federal banking agencies originally issued a 1993 policy statement that described \\nthe responsibilities of the BOD and management of banks and savings associations and of examiners \\nregarding the ALLL.   The December 2006 policy reiterated that guidance and made the policy applicable to \\ncredit unions.   Further, the policy provides key concepts and requirements pertaining to the ALLL included \\nin GAAP and existing supervisory guidance and describes the nature and purpose of the ALLL; the \\nresponsibilities of BODs, management, and examiners; factors to be considered in the estimation of the \\nALLL; and the objectives and elements of an effective loan review system, including a sound loan grading \\nsystem. \\n \\n \\n21 \\n \\nAlthough the November 2006 examination concluded that FPB’s ALLL methodology \\nwas adequate, examiners recommended that FPB increase the ALLL by $1.1 million due \\nto adversely classified loans that totaled $5.7 million.  However, in subsequent \\nexaminations, examiners’ conclusions regarding the adequacy of the ALLL methodology \\nchanged.  Specifically, examiners concluded that FPB’s ALLL methodology did not \\ncomply with interagency guidance included in FIL-105-2006.  Examiners recommended \\nsignificant increases in FPB’s ALLL to compensate for FPB’s inaccurate methodology \\nand to provide for the increased amount of adversely classified loans examiners \\nidentified.   \\n \\n • \\nAt the follow-up visitation in August 2007, adversely classified items totaled \\n$45 million, representing 129 percent of Tier 1 Capital and ALLL.   Of the \\n$45 million, $15.2 million represented adversely classified loans that were \\ndowngraded from FPB’s internal watch list, and $9 million represented adversely \\nclassified loans that bank management had not included on the watch list.  As a \\nresult, the ALLL had a shortfall of $6.1 million. \\n \\n • \\nThe May 2008 examination determined that adversely classified assets, including \\n$60.1 million in loans, had increased to $65.7 million, representing 403 percent of \\nTier 1 Capital and ALLL, resulting in a shortfall of $3.4 million in ALLL.   \\n \\nExaminers determined that shortages in ALLL could be attributable to the bank’s slow \\nidentification of problem loans and to an ineffective ALLL methodology that failed to \\nfollow the interagency policy on ALLL and GAAP.  As FPB’s assets deteriorated and the \\nneed to substantially increase the ALLL became apparent, earnings and capital were \\nsignificantly impacted.  FPB reported net losses for almost each year of operation (see \\nTable 7).   \\n \\nTable 7:  FPB Net Income or Loss (Dollars in Thousands)  \\n2003 \\n2004 \\n2005 \\n2006 \\n2007 \\n2008* \\n($432) \\n($961) \\n$19 \\n($546) \\n($18,997) \\n(12,448) \\n Source:  FPB December 31st UBPR data for each year, except as noted for 2008. \\n * Data is as of June 30, 2008 UBPR Report.   \\n \\n \\nAccording to the FDIC’s documentation on FPB’s applications, revised financial \\nprojections provided by FPB reflected that FPB expected a nominal loss of $28,000 for \\n2007 and showed a net income of $693,000 for 2008.   However, as indicated in Table 7, \\nthe financial projections were grossly inaccurate.  Further, during the exit meeting with \\nOFR examiners after the bank’s September 2007 examination, FPB officials attributed \\nthe bank’s earnings problem to the bank’s strategy for new branch offices at a time when \\nthe real estate market began to decline and stated that the lack of earnings was a “self-\\ninflicted” problem.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n22 \\n \\nRegulatory Supervision Related to Asset Quality \\n \\n FPB’s loan administration deficiencies should have warranted greater supervisory \\nconcern during the November 2006 examination when FPB was still in a de novo status \\nand had experienced significant growth in its loan portfolio between 2004 and 2006.   In \\naddition, FPB exhibited the following risk factors that DSC has determined to be \\nassociated with de novo institutions: \\n \\n• \\ninexperienced management and/or high turnover, \\n• \\nweak oversight by the BOD, \\n• \\nrapid asset growth, and \\n• \\na dominant BOD member.   \\n \\nFPB’s BOD and management aggressively grew its loan portfolio although the bank had \\nnot adequately identified, measured, monitored, or controlled risks; including \\nimplementing actions to address examiner concerns related to loan documentation and \\nadministration deficiencies.   Specifically, as a result of the 2006 examination, DSC \\nconcluded that FPB’s loan portfolio had begun to deteriorate noticeably and was highly \\nconcentrated in CRE/ADC loans, which presented a higher risk for the bank ; loan \\nadministration issues, which had been identified as early as the 2004 examination and by \\ninternal auditors in 2004 and 2005, remained uncorrected or in need of improvement.  \\nDSC also concluded that FPB’s risk profile was increasing.   \\n \\n According to the Examination Manual, the asset quality rating reflects the quantity of \\nexisting and potential credit risk associated with the loan and investment portfolios, and \\nother assets.  The ability of management to identify, measure, monitor, and control credit \\nrisk and the evaluation of the adequacy of the ALLL are also reflected in the asset quality \\nrating.  The Examination Manual provides guidance on which rating level is appropriate \\nbased on issues identified by examiners.  For example, the Examination Manual states \\nthat a rating of 3 is assigned when: \\n \\n• \\nAsset quality or credit administration practices are less than satisfactory and there \\nis a general need to improve those practices.   \\n \\n• \\nTrends may be stable or indicate deterioration in asset quality or an increase in \\nrisk exposure. \\n \\n • \\nThe level and severity of classified assets, other weaknesses, and risks require an \\nelevated level of supervisory concern. \\n \\nAt the November 2006 FDIC examination, examiners assessed the condition of the \\nbank’s loan portfolio and concluded that asset quality was satisfactory; however, \\nnoticeable loan portfolio deterioration had occurred since the prior examination.  \\nAdversely classified loans exceeded $5.7 million, which represented 15.66 percent of \\nTier 1 Leverage Capital.   In addition, loans cited as Special Mention for their \\nunderwriting deficiencies exceeded $4.6 million.  Collectively, $10.3 million in criticized \\n \\n \\n23 \\n \\nloans represented 28.31 percent of Tier 1 Leverage Capital.  Examiners also concluded \\nthat, while the level and severity of classified loans was low in relation to capital, \\nnoticeable loan portfolio deterioration had occurred since the last examination.  \\nExaminers also noted that the emergence of substandard and loss loans in the bank’s third \\nyear of operations was unusual and reflected increased significance given the elevated \\nand increasing risk profile of the institution and the bank’s pattern of weak underwriting \\npractices.  As a result, examiners made several recommendations to improve FPB’s risk \\nmanagement for CRE/ADC loans (see Tables 2 and 6).   \\n \\nIn addition, at the 2006 examination, although examiners concluded that FPB’s \\nmethodology for determining the adequacy of the ALLL was adequate, examiners also \\nconcluded that, based on the significant amount of adversely classified loans, FPB would \\nneed to increase the ALLL by up to $1.1 million by December 31, 2006.   \\n \\nFurther, at the November 2006 examination, examiners noted that risk management \\npolicies and practices for the loan function were not adequate and identified numerous \\nloan administration shortcomings that appeared to be systemic in nature.  Despite modest \\nimprovements since the prior examination related to loan documentation and \\nadministration weaknesses, the examiners emphasized the need for further improvement.  \\nFor example, the ALLL was inadequate, a significant number of loan files were found to \\nbe deficient, and exceptions to supervisory loan-to-value guidelines reported to the BOD \\neach quarter were found to improperly exclude certain loans.   \\n \\nHowever, the examiners’ evaluation of FPB’s asset quality at the November 2006 \\nexamination was based on the total of adversely classified loans—15.66 percent of Tier 1 \\nLeverage Capital—and did not consider the systemic nature of deficiencies in loan \\ndocumentation and administration or a qualitative assessment of the bank’s elevated CRE \\nrisk exposure, which the examiner concluded might adversely impact the bank’s financial \\ncondition.  DSC officials stated that the loan documentation and administration \\ndeficiencies identified during the 2006 examination were addressed in the examiners’ \\ndecision to downgrade FPB’s management to 3 and asset quality to 2. \\n \\nAfter the November 2006 examination, DSC’s offsite monitoring of FPB’s condition in \\nJuly 2007 reflected a significant increase in past due and nonaccrual loans and additional \\ncharge-offs based on March 31, 2007 financial data.  Although FPB’s earnings continued \\nto be weak, the bank was scheduled to open three branch offices in 2007.  As a result of \\nthese concerns, the DSC regional office requested the DSC field office to conduct a \\ntargeted visitation to review the actions taken by FPB management to: \\n \\n• \\ncorrect the deficiencies noted in the prior FDIC examination, \\n• \\nanalyze loans charged off and increases in past due loans, \\n• \\nreview earnings, and \\n• \\nreview risk management practices over the bank’s significant real estate exposure. \\n \\nShortly after the visitation began, the examiner noted significant deterioration in the loan \\nportfolio that prompted the OFR to accelerate its scheduled full-scope examination, \\n \\n \\n24 \\n \\nwhich was conducted in September 2007.  The FDIC also issued a problem bank \\nmemorandum in January 2008.   \\n \\nOn February 8, 2008, the OFR and the FDIC jointly issued an MOU10 to FPB.  The \\nMOU, among other things, required FPB to: \\n \\n• \\nIncrease the BOD’s participation in the supervision of the bank’s operations. \\n• \\nObtain qualified management and staffing for the loan department. \\n• \\nImprove asset quality. \\n • \\nAmend loan and other policies to establish:  \\no \\nstronger, appropriate loan concentration guidelines for all loan types; \\no \\nprocedures and criteria for approving loan policy exceptions; \\no \\nguidelines for establishing and monitoring interest reserves, appropriate \\nloan-to-value limits, and determining realistic collateral values; \\no \\nspecific criteria for the use of interest-only loans with balloon payments; \\no \\ncomprehensive ADC loan risk management systems; and  \\no \\nrequirements for obtaining current financial statements and/or tax returns \\nfor borrowers and guarantors and ensuring insurance coverage on any \\ncollateral. \\n• \\nDevelop a written plan to monitor concentrations of risk in relation to total capital \\nthat included:  appropriate limits for concentrations of credit by industry, product \\nline, type of collateral, and borrower; and establish limits and identify the risks \\nassociated with the concentration of CRE loans.   \\n \\nAlthough the 2008 MOU addressed issues related to FPB’s asset quality and loan \\nadministration and documentation, greater concern during the 2006 examination, \\nregarding the severity of these deficiencies and FPB’s history of not adequately \\naddressing these issues for more than 2 years, could have led to elevated supervisory \\nattention and earlier supervisory action. \\n \\n \\nIMPLEMENTATION OF PCA \\n \\nThe purpose of PCA is to resolve problems of insured depository institutions at the least \\npossible long-term cost to the DIF.  PCA establishes a system of restrictions and \\nmandatory and discretionary supervisory actions that are to be triggered depending on an \\ninstitution’s capital levels.  Part 325 of the FDIC’s Rules and Regulations implements \\nPCA requirements by establishing a framework for taking prompt corrective action \\nagainst insured nonmember banks that are not adequately capitalized.   \\n \\nThe FDIC evaluated FPB’s capital position; assigned capital component ratings; included \\ncapital-related provisions in informal and formal actions, including a PCA Directive, in \\n                                                           \\n10 The OFR and FDIC initially considered issuing a Cease and Desist Order (C&amp;D) against FPB.  However, \\nin the decision-making process regarding the type of supervisory action to impose, OFR considered actions \\ntaken by FPB’s new management to address the bank’s financial condition and asset quality-related issues \\nand decided to issue an MOU rather than a C&amp;D.  The MOU included the same provisions that had been \\nproposed for the C&amp;D.   \\n \\n \\n25 \\n \\naccordance with regulatory guidelines; and provided PCA notification letters.   The \\nFDIC’s November 2005 examination concluded that FPB’s declining trend in capital \\nratios was a result of the bank’s asset growth and that, in order to remain well capitalized \\ngiven its significant growth rate, FPB had raised additional capital through a second stock \\noffering.  In fact, FPB’s rapid growth from 2003 to 2006—the bank’s de novo period—\\nwas supported by significant stock issuances to raise more than $35 million in capital, as \\nshown in Table 8 below.   \\n \\n Table 8:  FPB Capital Stock Issuances \\n2003 \\n2004 \\n2005 \\n2006 \\n2007 \\n \\n($000) \\nCommon Stock Issued \\n$8,616 \\n$144 \\n$8,192 \\n$18,345 \\n$0 \\nCumulative \\n$8,616 \\n$8,760 \\n$16,952 \\n$35,297 \\n$35,297 \\nSource:  An FDIC Supervisory History memorandum.  \\n \\n \\n As of December 31, 2007, DSC officials concluded that FPB’s capital position had \\ndeteriorated and, considering FPB’s decline in capital, excessive level of problem assets, \\nsignificant concentration in CRE loans relative to capital, and questionable earning \\nprospects, the institution’s capital was considered to be marginal.   On February 8, 2008, \\nthe FDIC and OFR jointly issued an MOU.  The MOU included provisions related to \\ncapital and required FPB to:  \\n \\n• \\nSubmit, within 60 days, a capital plan for maintaining a Tier 1 Capital ratio of no \\nless than 8 percent.  The plan, at a minimum, was to address FPB’s current and \\nfuture capital requirements, including the maintenance of adequate risk-based and \\nTier 1 Capital ratios; the volume of FPB’s adversely classified and problem \\nassets; the bank’s anticipated level of earnings; and the source and timing of \\nadditional funds to fulfill future ALLL and capital requirements.   \\n \\n• \\nDevelop a written capital plan acceptable to the OFR and FDIC to enable the bank \\nto monitor concentrations of risk in relation to total capital. \\n \\nIn its Consolidated Report of Condition and Income (Call) Report, dated December 31, \\n2007, FPB reported that it held brokered deposits totaling $13.5 million.   On March 14, \\n2008, the FDIC issued a letter restricting FPB’s use of brokered deposits because FPB’s \\ncapital category fell below the well capitalized category.  In response to the FDIC’s letter, \\nFPB notified the FDIC that it had not rolled over or renewed any brokered deposits. \\n \\n On May 1, 2008, the FDIC notified FPB that based on its March 31, 2008 Call Report \\ndata, FPB was considered to be significantly undercapitalized for PCA purposes.   The \\nFDIC required FPB to develop and submit a capital restoration plan (CRP) within \\n45 days of April 30, 2008.  The plan was to provide information on: \\n \\n \\n26 \\n \\n• \\nsteps the bank would take to become adequately capitalized; \\n \\n• \\nlevels of capital to be attained during each year in which the plan would be in \\neffect; \\n \\n• \\nhow the bank would comply with the restrictions and requirements related to asset \\ngrowth restrictions and prior approval of acquisitions, new branches, and new \\nlines of business; and  \\n \\n• \\ntypes and levels of activities in which the bank would engage.   \\n \\n The bank submitted its CRP on June 6, 2008, which the FDIC reviewed and requested \\nFPB to update.   On June 25, 2008, the FDIC issued a PCA Directive.  Mandatory actions \\nincluded the submission of another CRP and restrictions on asset growth, acquisitions, \\nnew activities, new branches, payment of dividends or making any other capital \\ndistribution, or payment of management fees.   \\n \\nPCA’s focus is on capital, and capital can be a lagging indicator of an institution’s \\nfinancial health.   In addition, the use of PCA Directives depends on the accuracy of \\ncapital ratios in a financial institution’s Call Reports.  FPB’s capital remained in the well \\ncapitalized to adequately capitalized range long after its operations had begun to \\ndeteriorate because of problems related to management, asset quality, risk management \\ncontrols, and net losses.  In particular, the ALLL was significantly underfunded which \\noverstated capital and underreported the deterioration of the loan portfolio.   \\n \\n FPB’s efforts to comply with the MOU to improve the bank’s condition and raise \\nadditional capital proved unsuccessful.   Further, by the time FPB’s capital level fell \\nbelow the required threshold necessary to implement PCA, the bank’s condition had \\ndeteriorated to the point at which the institution could not raise additional needed capital, \\nestimated to total $30 million, through its BOD or find other investors to assist in \\ncapitalizing the bank.   \\n \\n \\nCORPORATION COMMENTS \\n \\nOn February 12, 2009, the Director, DSC, provided a written response to the draft report.  \\nDSC’s response is provided in its entirety as Appendix 3 of this report.  In its response, \\nDSC agreed with the OIG’s conclusions regarding the causes of FPB’s failure and the \\nresulting material loss to the DIF, and DSC’s supervisory activities related to FPB.   DSC \\nalso agreed that the November 2006 examination results related to the loan \\ndocumentation and administration deficiencies should have warranted greater supervisory \\naction.   \\n \\nDSC also stated that it has undertaken a number of initiatives related to the supervision of \\nfinancial institutions that have high-risk lending activities, including concentrations in \\nCRE and/or the use of interest reserves.  Additionally in December 2008, DSC conducted \\n \\n \\n27 \\n \\non-site visitations of certain financial institutions that resulted in downgraded ratings and \\ninitiating corrective programs.   \\n \\nIt should be noted the OIG did not conclude on specific examination ratings or \\nsupervisory actions.  Rather, we evaluated the FDIC’s overall supervision of the \\ninstitution.  In this regard, we concluded that greater supervisory concern was warranted \\nas a result of the 2006 examination due to the deficiencies identified, the de novo status \\nof the institution, and its increasing risk profile.   \\n \\n \\n28 \\nAPPENDIX 1 \\nOBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND METHODOLOGY \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n29 \\nObjectives \\n \\nWe performed this audit in accordance with section 38(k) of the FDI Act, which provides \\nthat if a deposit insurance fund incurs a material loss with respect to an insured \\ndepository institution, the Inspector General of the appropriate federal banking agency \\nshall prepare a report to that agency, reviewing the agency’s supervision of the \\ninstitution.  The FDI Act requires that the report be completed within 6 months after it \\nbecomes apparent that a material loss has been incurred.   \\n \\nOur audit objectives were to (1) determine the causes of the financial institution’s failure \\nand resulting material loss to the DIF and (2) evaluate the FDIC’s supervision of the \\ninstitution, including implementation of the PCA provisions of section 38.   \\n \\nWe conducted the audit from August 2008 to January 2009 in accordance with generally \\naccepted government auditing standards.  However, due to the limited scope and \\nobjectives established for material loss reviews, which are generally applied to just one \\nfinancial institution , it was not feasible to address certain aspects of the standards, as \\ndescribed on the next page.   \\n \\n \\n Scope and Methodology \\n \\nThe scope of this audit included an analysis of FPB’s operations, which opened on \\nDecember 8, 2003, until its failure on August 1, 2008.  Our review also entailed an \\nevaluation of the regulatory supervision of the institution over the same period and the \\napplication process for FPB.   \\n \\nTo achieve the audit objectives, we performed the following procedures and techniques: \\n \\n• Analyzed examination and visitation reports and examination work papers \\nprepared by the FDIC and the State of Florida’s Office of Financial Regulation \\nexaminers from 2004 to 2008.   \\n \\n• Reviewed the following: \\n• Bank data and correspondence maintained at the DSC’s ARO and Tampa \\nField Office.   \\n \\n• Reports prepared by the Division of Resolutions and Receiverships (DRR) \\nand DSC relating to the bank’s closure. \\n \\n• Records of the bank’s external auditor at the offices of Hacker, Johnson &amp; \\nSmith, in Tampa, Florida; and CPA Associates in Bradenton, Florida.   \\n APPENDIX 1 \\n• Bank records maintained by DRR in Dallas, Texas.  \\n \\n• Pertinent DSC policies and procedures. \\n \\n • Interviewed the following FDIC officials: \\n• DSC management in Washington, D.C.; Atlanta, Georgia; and Tampa, \\nFlorida.   \\n \\n• DRR officials at the Dallas Regional Office. \\n \\n• FDIC examiners from the DSC Tampa Field Office who participated in FPB \\nexaminations.   \\n \\n• Met with officials from the State of Florida’s Office of Financial Regulation in \\nTallahassee, Florida, to discuss their historical perspective of the institution, its \\nexaminations, state banking laws, and other activities regarding the state’s \\nsupervision of the bank. \\n \\n• Researched various banking laws and regulations, including State of Florida \\nbanking laws. \\n \\n \\nInternal Control, Reliance on Computer-processed Information, Performance  \\nMeasurement, and Compliance With Laws and Regulations \\n \\nDue to the limited nature of the audit objectives, we did not assess DSC’s overall internal \\ncontrol or management control structure.  We performed a limited review of FPB’s \\nmanagement controls pertaining to its operations as discussed in the finding section of \\nthis report.  For purposes of the audit, we did not rely on computer-processed data to \\nsupport our significant findings or conclusions.  Our review centered on interviews, \\nROEs, and correspondence and other evidence to support our audit.   \\n \\nThe Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (the Results Act) directs \\nExecutive Branch agencies to develop a customer-focused strategic plan, align agency \\nprograms and activities with concrete missions and goals, manage and measure results to \\njustify appropriations and authorizations, and design budgets that reflect strategic \\nmissions.   For this material loss review, we did not assess the strengths and weaknesses \\nof DSC’s annual performance plan in meeting the requirements of the Results Act \\nbecause such an assessment was not part of the audit objectives.  DSC’s compliance with \\nthe Results Act is reviewed in OIG program audits of DSC operations.   \\n \\n Regarding compliance with laws and regulations, we performed tests to determine \\nwhether the FDIC had complied with the provisions of PCA and limited tests to \\ndetermine compliance with certain aspects of the FDI Act.   Additionally, we assessed the \\nrisk of fraud and abuse related to our objectives in the course of evaluating audit \\nevidence. \\n \\n \\n30 \\nAPPENDIX 2 \\nGLOSSARY OF TERMS \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n31 \\nTerm \\nDefinition \\nAdversely Classified \\nAssets \\nAssets subject to criticism and/or comment in an ROE.   Adversely classified \\nassets are allocated on the basis of risk (lowest to highest) to three \\ncategories: \\n• \\nSubstandard,  \\n• \\nDoubtful, and  \\n• \\nLoss.  \\n \\n \\n Concentration \\nA concentration is a significantly large volume of economically related \\nassets that an institution has advanced or committed to a certain industry, \\nperson, entity, or affiliated group.   These assets may, in the aggregate, \\npresent a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of the institution.   \\n \\n \\nLoan Loss Reserve also \\ncalled Allowance for Loan \\nand Lease Losses (ALLL) \\nFederally insured depository institutions must maintain an ALLL level that \\nis adequate to absorb the estimated credit losses associated with the loan \\nand lease portfolio (including all binding commitments to lend).  To the \\nextent not provided for in a separate liability account, the ALLL should also \\nbe sufficient to absorb estimated loan losses associated with off-balance \\nsheet loan instruments such as standby letters of credit.   \\n \\n \\nMemorandum of \\nUnderstanding (MOU) \\nAn informal corrective administrative action for institutions considered to \\nbe of supervisory concern but which have not deteriorated to the point \\nwhere they warrant formal administrative action.  As a general rule, an \\nMOU is to be considered for all institutions rated a composite 3. \\n \\n \\nPrompt Corrective Action \\n(PCA) \\nThe purpose of PCA is to resolve the problems of insured depository \\ninstitutions at the least possible long-term cost to the DIF.   Part 325 of the \\nFDIC Rules and Regulations, 12 Code of Federal Regulations section \\n325.101, et. seq., implements section 38, Prompt Corrective Action, of the \\nFDI Act, 12 United States Code section 1831(o), by establishing a \\nframework for taking prompt supervisory actions against insured \\nnonmember banks that are less than adequately capitalized.  The following \\nterms are used to describe capital adequacy:  Well Capitalized, Adequately \\nCapitalized, Undercapitalized, Significantly Undercapitalized, and Critically \\nUndercapitalized. \\n \\n \\nUniform Bank \\nPerformance Report \\n(UBPR) \\n \\n The UBPR is an individual analysis of a financial institution’s financial data \\nand ratios that includes extensive comparisons to peer group performance.  \\nThe Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council produces the UBPR \\nquarterly, from Call Report data submitted by banks, for use by banking \\nsupervisors, bankers, and the general public.   \\n \\n \\n \\nAPPENDIX  3 \\n \\nCORPORATION COMMENTS \\n \\n \\nAPPENDIX 3 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n33 \\nAPPENDIX 3 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n34 \\nAPPENDIX 4 \\nACRONYMS IN THE REPORT \\n \\n \\n35 \\n \\nAcronym \\nDefinition \\nADC \\nAcquisition, Development, and Construction \\nALLL \\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses \\nARO \\nAtlanta Regional Office \\nBOD \\nBoard of Directors \\nCAMELS \\nCapital, Asset Quality, Management, Earnings, Liquidity, and \\nSensitivity to Market Risk \\nCD \\nCertificate of Deposit \\nC&amp;D \\nCease and Desist \\nCFO \\nChief Financial Officer \\nCLP \\nContingency Liquidity Plan \\nCRE \\nCommercial Real Estate \\nCRP \\nCapital Restoration Plan \\nDIF \\nDeposit Insurance Fund \\nDRR \\nDivision of Resolutions and Receiverships \\nDSC \\nDivision of Supervision and Consumer Protection \\nFDI \\nFederal Deposit Insurance \\nFHLB \\nFederal Home Loan Bank \\nFIL \\nFinancial Institution Letter \\nFPB \\nFirst Priority Bank \\nGAAP \\nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles \\nLPO \\nLoan Production Office \\nMOU \\nMemorandum of Understanding \\nOFR \\nOffice of Financial Regulation \\nOIG \\nOffice of Inspector General \\nPCA \\nPrompt Corrective Action \\nROE \\nReport of Examination \\nUBPR \\nUniform Bank Performance Report \\nUFIRS \\nUniform Financial Institution Rating System \\n \\n</td>\n",

Resulting losses severely eroded FPB’s earnings and capital, and negatively \\nimpacted liquidity, leading to the bank’s failure and a material loss to the DIF.   \\n \\nManagement.  FPB’s Board of Directors (BOD) did not ensure that bank management identified, \\nmeasured, monitored, and controlled the risk of the institution’s activities.  In addition, the BOD did \\nnot ensure that corrective actions were implemented in response to examiner and auditor \\nrecommendations.   Further, FPB developed a business plan governing its activities; however, the plan \\nwas not kept current or followed.  Although rapid asset growth, declining asset quality, and poor \\nearnings further increased liquidity risk, bank management did not put into place the necessary controls \\nfor liquidity management, including an adequate contingency liquidity plan (CLP). \\n \\nAsset Quality.  FPB’s CRE/ADC loans were concentrated in a rapidly growing local marketplace.   A \\nsignificant portion of the loan portfolio included high-risk terms, such as high loan-to-value ratios, \\ninterest-only basis with balloon payments, and interest reserves used to capitalize interest expense.  \\nHowever, FPB did not follow sound loan underwriting standards and administration practices, \\nincluding those pertaining to:  (1) effectively identifying loan portfolio risk, (2) obtaining current \\nappraisals and financial statements on borrowers and guarantors, (3) ensuring appropriate use and \\ncontrol over interest reserves, and (4) providing appropriate reports to the BOD on loan concentrations, \\nspeculative lending, and interest reserves.   Also, FPB did not maintain a sufficient allowance for loan \\nand lease losses (ALLL).  As asset quality declined and losses were recognized, FPB’s liquidity \\nposition became critical, and earnings and capital were eroded.   \\n \\n Supervision.  The FDIC and OFR conducted timely examinations of FPB.  Additionally, the FDIC \\nprovided oversight through its off-site monitoring process and accelerated examinations as a result of \\nidentified deficiencies.   As a result of the November 2006 examination, the FDIC delayed its approval \\nof three FPB branch applications until FPB provided information on how the bank would address \\nexamination concerns.  As a result of the September 2007 examination, and after various OFR and FPB \\ndiscussions regarding the bank’s condition and proposed regulatory actions, the FDIC, in conjunction \\nwith the OFR, took supervisory action in February 2008 to address management’s failure to implement \\ncorrective actions in response to audit and/or examiner concerns.  Such concerns included, but were not \\nlimited to, inadequate management oversight, poor asset quality, the need to increase capital and \\nimprove earnings, an inadequate ALLL, noncompliance with laws and regulations, and an outdated \\nliquidity policy.  Further, in March and May 2008, the FDIC notified FPB of applicable restrictions \\nunder PCA when FPB fell below the well capitalized category, and in June 2008, the FDIC issued a \\nPCA Directive.  The FDIC has authority to take a wide range of supervisory actions.  In the case of \\nFPB, however, supervisory actions were not always timely and effective in addressing the bank’s most \\nsignificant problems.   \\n \\nThe FDIC has taken steps to improve its supervisory review of business plans, oversight of financial \\ninstitutions that have CRE loan concentrations and use interest reserves, and CLPs.  However, FPB’s \\nloan documentation and administration deficiencies should have warranted greater concern during the \\n2006 examination.   Specifically, during that examination, FPB was in a de novo status; the loan \\nportfolio had begun to deteriorate and was highly concentrated in high-risk CRE/ADC loans; loan \\nadministration issues, identified as early as the FDIC’s 2004 examination, were uncorrected or in need \\nof improvement; ALLL was inadequate; and FPB’s risk profile was increasing.   Greater concern \\nregarding FPB’s loan documentation and administration deficiencies could have led to elevated \\nsupervisory attention and earlier supervisory action.   \\n \\nThe FDIC OIG plans to issue a summary report on the material loss reviews it is conducting and will \\nmake appropriate recommendations related to the failure of FPB and other FDIC-supervised banks at \\nthat time. \\n \\nManagement Response \\n \\nDSC provided a written response to the draft report.  DSC agreed with the OIG’s conclusions \\nregarding the causes of FPB’s failure and resulting material loss and the supervisory activities related \\nto FPB.   DSC also agreed that the results of the November 2006 examination related to FPB’s loan \\ndocumentation and administration deficiencies should have warranted greater supervisory action.   \\n      To view the full report, go to www.fdicig.gov/2009reports.asp\\n              \\n \\n \\n  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation \\n \\nWhy We Did The Audit \\n \\nAs required by section 38(k) of the \\nFederal Deposit Insurance (FDI) Act, \\nthe Office of Inspector General (OIG) \\nconducted a material loss review of the \\nfailure of First Priority Bank (FPB), \\nBradenton, Florida.   On August 1, 2008, \\nthe State of Florida, Office of Financial \\nRegulation (OFR), closed FPB and \\nnamed the FDIC as receiver.   On \\nAugust 19, 2008, the FDIC notified the \\nOIG that FPB’s total assets at closing \\nwere $241 million, and the estimated \\nloss to the Deposit Insurance Fund \\n(DIF) was $72 million. \\n \\nThe audit objectives were to \\n(1) determine the causes of the financial \\ninstitution’s failure and resulting \\nmaterial loss to the DIF and (2) evaluate \\nthe FDIC’s supervision of the \\ninstitution, including implementation of \\nthe Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) \\nprovisions of section 38. \\n \\nBackground \\n \\nFPB was a state-chartered nonmember \\nbank insured on December 8, 2003.   As \\na de novo bank for its first 3 years in \\noperation, FPB was subject to additional \\nsupervisory oversight and regulatory \\ncontrols, including the development and \\nmaintenance of a current business plan \\nand increased examination frequency.  \\nWith five branches in Florida, FPB \\nengaged principally in traditional \\nbanking activities within its local \\nmarketplace, which experienced a \\nsignificant economic downturn starting \\nin 2006.  FPB had no holding company, \\nsubsidiaries, or affiliates.   \\n \\nFPB’s assets consisted principally of \\ncommercial real estate (CRE) loans, \\nincluding a significant concentration in \\nresidential acquisition, development, \\nand construction (ADC) loans.   The \\nFDIC has recognized the increased risk \\nthat CRE loans present to financial \\ninstitutions and has issued guidance that \\ndescribes a risk management framework \\nto effectively identify, measure, \\nmonitor, and control CRE concentration \\nrisk.   That framework includes effective \\noversight by bank management, \\nincluding the Board of Directors (BOD) \\nand senior executives, and sound loan \\nunderwriting, administration, and \\nportfolio management practices. \\nContents                                                                                                    Page \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nBACKGROUND  \\n2\\n \\nRESULTS IN BRIEF \\n4\\nMANAGEMENT \\n6\\n     Ineffective BOD and Management \\n6\\n          Risk Management \\n9\\n          Inadequate Actions for Apparent Violations of Regulatory Requirements \\n9\\n          Deviations from FPB’s Business Plan \\n10\\n          FPB Branch Offices \\n11\\n          Lack of a Comprehensive CLP \\n12\\n     Regulatory Supervision Related to Management \\n14\\n \\nASSET QUALITY \\n17\\n     Examiner Concerns and Recommendations Regarding Asset Quality \\n18\\n     Concentration in CRE and ADC Loans \\n20 \\n           Interest Reserves \\n21\\n         Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses \\n21\\n     Regulatory Supervision Related to Asset Quality \\n23\\n \\nIMPLEMENTATION OF PCA \\n25\\n \\nCORPORATION COMMENTS \\n \\n27\\nAPPENDICES   \\n     1.

Rau \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nAssistant Inspector General for Audits \\n \\nSUBJECT: \\nMaterial Loss Review of First Priority Bank, Bradenton, \\nFlorida (Report No. AUD-09-003) \\n \\n \\nAs required by section 38(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act), the Office \\nof Inspector General (OIG) conducted a material loss1 review of the failure of First \\nPriority Bank (FPB), Bradenton, Florida.   On August 1, 2008, the State of Florida, Office \\nof Financial Regulation (OFR), closed FPB and named the FDIC as receiver.   On \\nAugust 19, 2008, the FDIC notified the OIG that FPB’s total assets at closing were \\n$241 million, and the estimated loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) was \\n$72 million.   \\n \\n When the DIF incurs a material loss with respect to an insured depository institution for \\nwhich the FDIC is appointed receiver, the FDI Act states that the Inspector General of the \\nappropriate federal banking agency shall make a written report to that agency which \\nreviews the agency’s supervision of the institution, including the agency’s \\nimplementation of FDI Act section 38, Prompt Corrective Action (PCA), ascertains why \\nthe institution’s problems resulted in a material loss to the DIF, and makes \\nrecommendations to prevent future losses.   \\n \\nThe audit objectives were to:  (1) determine the causes of the financial institution’s \\nfailure and resulting material loss to the DIF and (2) evaluate the FDIC’s supervision2 of \\nthe institution, including implementation of the PCA provisions of section 38.  \\n Appendix I contains details on our objectives, scope, and methodology; Appendix 2\\n                                                           \\n1 As defined by section 38 of the FDI Act, a loss is material if it exceeds the greater of $25 million or \\n2 percent of an institution’s total assets at the time the FDIC was appointed receiver.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n2 The FDIC’s supervision program promotes the safety and soundness of FDIC-supervised institutions, \\nprotects consumers’ rights, and promotes community investment initiatives by FDIC-supervised insured \\ndepository institutions.  The FDIC’s Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection (DSC) (1) performs \\nexaminations of FDIC-supervised institutions to assess their overall financial condition, management \\npolicies and practices, including internal control systems; and compliance with applicable laws and \\nregulations; and (2) issues related guidance to institutions and examiners.   \\n \\ncontains a glossary of terms.  The FDIC’s response to the draft of this report is contained \\nin Appendix 3.  Acronyms used in the report are listed in Appendix 4.  This report \\npresents the FDIC OIG’s analysis of FPB’s failure and the FDIC’s efforts to require \\nFPB’s management to operate the bank in a safe and sound manner.  The FDIC OIG is \\nperforming similar analyses regarding the failure of other FDIC-supervised financial \\ninstitutions.  A planned capping report will summarize our observations on the major \\ncauses, trends, and common characteristics of failures resulting in a material loss to the \\nDIF.  Recommendations in the capping report will address the FDIC’s supervision of the \\ninstitutions, including implementation of the PCA provisions of section 38. \\n \\n \\nBACKGROUND \\n \\nFPB was a state-chartered nonmember bank, which received approval to open for \\nbusiness on March 27, 2003 subject to certain conditions by the OFR.  The bank was \\ninsured by the FDIC effective December 8, 2003.  FPB, which was headquartered in \\nBradenton, Florida:    \\n \\n• \\nhad a total of five branches in Bradenton, Sarasota, and Venice, Florida; \\n \\n• \\nprovided traditional banking activities within its marketplace;   \\n \\n• \\nspecialized in commercial lending, with concentrations in commercial real \\nestate (CRE), including acquisition, development, and construction (ADC) \\nloans; and \\n \\n• \\nused jumbo certificates of deposit (CD), brokered deposits, Internet deposits, \\nand Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings as funding sources, in \\naddition to core deposits, to fund asset growth.   \\n \\nFPB did not have a holding company, subsidiaries, or affiliates.  FPB’s local marketplace \\nwas, at one time, characterized by rapidly appreciating real estate values.  However, real \\nestate values experienced a significant downturn, causing severe deterioration in FPB’s \\nasset value, excessive operating losses, and severely eroded capital, and the real estate \\nconstruction industry was negatively impacted.   \\n \\nDSC’s Atlanta Regional Office (ARO) and OFR alternated safety and soundness \\nexaminations of FPB, conducting six examinations from June 2004 through May 2008.3  \\n DSC also conducted a visitation concurrently with an OFR examination during June 2004 \\nand another visitation during August 2007.  At the September 2007 examination, FPB’s  \\n                                                           \\n3 The FDIC Report of Examination (ROE) for the May 5, 2008 examination was a draft report and was not \\nofficially issued to FPB.   \\n \\n \\n2\\n \\ncomposite rating was downgraded to 4,4 indicating unsafe and unsound practices or \\nconditions and a distinct possibility of failure if such conditions and practices were not \\nsatisfactorily addressed and resolved.   As a result of the May 2008 examination, FPB’s \\ncomposite rating was downgraded to 5, indicating extremely unsafe and unsound \\npractices or conditions; critically deficient performance, often with inadequate risk \\nmanagement practices; and great supervisory concern.  Institutions in this category pose a \\nsignificant risk to the DIF and have a high probability of failure. \\n \\nFurther, with respect to selected component ratings, as indicated in the figure below, at \\nthe November 2006 examination, FPB’s management rating was downgraded to 3, and \\nasset quality was downgraded to 2.  At the following September 2007 examination, \\nFPB’s asset quality ratings were downgraded to 4.   As a result of the May 2008 \\nexamination, examiners downgraded FPB’s asset quality and liquidity ratings to 5.   \\nFPB's Composite, Management, Asset Quality, and Liquidity Ratings\\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\nRatings (Highest to Lowest)\\n Composite Rating\\n Management Rating\\n Asset Quality Rating\\n Liquidity Rating\\n1 \\n2 \\n3 \\n4 \\n5 \\n \\nJune 04             Dec 04               Nov 05              Nov 06              Sept 07              May 08 \\nSource:  ROEs for FPB. \\n \\n \\n To address examination concerns, including apparent violations of laws and regulations, \\ninadequate risk management controls, and other safety and soundness issues, the OFR \\nand the FDIC jointly issued a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in February 2008, \\nand the FDIC issued a PCA Directive to FPB in June 2008.  Additionally, in February \\n                                                           \\n4 Financial institution regulators and examiners use the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System \\n(UFIRS) to evaluate a bank’s performance in six components represented by the CAMELS acronym:  \\nCapital adequacy, Asset quality, Management practices, Earnings performance, Liquidity position, and \\nSensitivity to market risk.  Each component, and an overall composite score, is assigned a rating of 1 \\nthrough 5, with 1 having the least regulatory concern and 5 having the greatest concern. \\n \\n \\n 3\\n \\n2008, the FDIC notified FPB that the Corporation considered the bank to be in “troubled \\ncondition” and added the institution to the FDIC’s formal problem bank list.   \\n \\n Details on FPB’s financial condition, as of June 2008, and for the 5 preceding calendar \\nyears follow in Table 1.   \\n \\nTable 1:  Financial Condition of FPB  \\n  \\n30-Jun-08 \\n31-Dec-07 \\n31-Dec-06 \\n31-Dec-05 \\n31-Dec-04 \\n31-Dec-03 \\nTotal Assets ($000s) \\n$258,610 \\n$262,563 \\n$245,343 \\n$140,550 \\n$63,165 \\n$11,136 \\nTotal Deposits ($000) \\n$226,698 \\n$231,389 \\n$211,019 \\n$124,566 \\n$55,735 \\n$2,941 \\nTotal Loans ($000s) \\n$189,108 \\n$207,872 \\n$192,699 \\n$122,618 \\n$44,771 \\n$199 \\n Net Loans and Leases Growth Rate \\n-9.43% \\n3.61% \\n55.75% \\n175.51% \\nNA \\nNA \\nNet Income (Loss) ($000s) \\n($12,448) \\n($18,997) \\n($546) \\n$19 \\n($961) \\n($432) \\nLoan Mix (% of Avg.

Resulting losses severely eroded \\nFPB’s earnings and capital, and negatively impacted liquidity, leading to the bank’s \\nfailure and a material loss to the DIF.  Specifically: \\n \\n \\nManagement.   FPB’s Board of Directors (BOD) did not ensure that bank management \\nidentified, measured, monitored, and controlled the risk of the institution’s activities.   In \\naddition, the BOD did not ensure that corrective actions were implemented in response to \\nexaminer and auditor recommendations.  Although FPB developed a business plan \\ngoverning its activities, the plan was not kept current or followed.  Further, FPB rapidly \\nexpanded branch and lending operations without sufficient attention to associated risk \\nmanagement controls.  Although rapid asset growth, declining asset quality, and poor \\nearnings further increased liquidity risk, bank management did not put into place the \\n \\n \\n4\\n \\nnecessary controls for liquidity management, including an adequate contingency liquidity \\nplan (CLP).5\\n \\n \\nAsset Quality.  FPB’s CRE/ADC loans were concentrated in a rapidly growing local \\nmarketplace.  A significant portion of the loan portfolio included high-risk terms, such as \\nhigh loan-to-value ratios, interest-only with balloon payments, and interest reserves used \\nto capitalize interest expense.   However, FPB did not follow sound loan underwriting \\nstandards and administration practices, including those pertaining to:  (1) effectively \\nidentifying loan portfolio risk; (2) obtaining current appraisals and financial statements \\non borrowers and guarantors; (3) ensuring appropriate use and control over interest \\nreserves; and (4) providing appropriate reports to the BOD on loan concentrations, \\nspeculative lending, and interest reserves.   Also, FPB did not maintain a sufficient \\nallowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL).  As asset quality declined and losses were \\nrecognized, FPB’s liquidity position became critical, and earnings and capital were \\neroded.   \\n \\n \\n Supervision.  The FDIC and OFR conducted timely examinations of FPB.  Additionally, \\nthe FDIC provided oversight through its off-site monitoring process and accelerated \\nexaminations as a result of identified deficiencies.   As a result of the November 2006 \\nexamination, the FDIC delayed its approval of three FPB branch applications until FPB \\nprovided information on how the bank would address those examination concerns.  As a \\nresult of the September 2007 examination, and after various discussions between OFR \\nand FPB regarding the bank’s condition and proposed regulatory actions, the FDIC, in \\nconjunction with the OFR, took supervisory action in February 2008 to address \\nmanagement’s failure to implement corrective actions in response to audit and examiner \\nconcerns.  Such concerns included, but were not limited to, inadequate management \\noversight, poor asset quality, the need to increase capital and improve earnings, an \\ninadequate ALLL, noncompliance with laws and regulations, and an outdated liquidity \\npolicy.   Further, in March and May 2008, the FDIC notified FPB of applicable \\nrestrictions under PCA when FPB fell below the well capitalized category, and in June \\n2008, the FDIC issued a PCA Directive.  The FDIC has authority to take a wide range of \\nsupervisory actions.  In the case of FPB, however, supervisory actions were not always \\ntimely and effective in addressing the bank’s most significant problems.   \\n \\nThe FDIC has taken steps to improve its supervisory review of business plans, oversight \\nof financial institutions that have CRE loan concentrations and use interest reserves, and \\nCLPs.  However, FPB’s loan documentation and administration deficiencies should have \\nwarranted greater concern as a result of the 2006 examination.  Specifically, during that \\nexamination, FPB was in a de novo6 status; the loan portfolio had begun to deteriorate \\nand was highly concentrated in high-risk ADC loans; loan administration issues, \\nidentified as early as the FDIC’s 2004 examination, were uncorrected or in need of \\n                                                           \\n5 DSC uses the terms contingency liquidity plan, liquidity contingency plans, and contingency funding \\nplans interchangeably.  For purposes of this report, we use the term contingency liquidity plans.   \\n6 De novo institutions are subject to additional supervisory oversight and regulatory controls, including the \\ndevelopment and maintenance of a current business plan and increased examination frequency.   \\n \\n \\n 5\\n \\n \\n \\n 6\\n                                                          \\nimprovement; ALLL was inadequate; and FPB’s risk profile was increasing.  Greater \\nconcern regarding FPB’s loan documentation and administration deficiencies could have \\nled to elevated supervisory attention and earlier supervisory action.   \\n \\n \\nMANAGEMENT \\n \\nExaminations in 2004 and 2005 resulted in a 2 rating for FPB management.  At \\nsubsequent examinations, the rating was progressively downgraded, indicating deficient \\nBOD and management performance, risk management practices that were inadequate, \\nand excessive risk exposure.  By 2006, the bank’s problems and significant risks had \\nbeen inadequately identified, measured, monitored, or controlled and required immediate \\naction by FPB’s BOD and management to preserve the safety and soundness of the \\ninstitution.  In addition, FPB rapidly expanded the bank’s branch operations without \\nregard to loan documentation and administration deficiencies and the inadequacy of other \\nrisk management controls.   \\n \\n \\nIneffective BOD and Management \\n \\nExaminer concerns with FPB’s BOD and management were noted at the bank’s \\nexaminations conducted in 2004 and 2005, including concerns related to excessive \\ngrowth; noncompliance with laws and regulations and the OFR and FDIC final orders \\nregarding the bank’s charter and deposit insurance approval; and FPB’s business plan.7  \\nMany of those issues continued throughout the bank’s existence.   FPB examinations \\nshowed a continuing pattern of inadequate risk management for the loan portfolio, \\nbeginning with the first examination in June 2004; growing severity regarding the lack of \\nloan documentation; inadequate loan administration; and significant loan portfolio \\ndeterioration, culminating in an increasing risk profile for the institution.   The loan \\ndocumentation and administration deficiencies were repeated and compounded as noted \\nin the 2005 through 2008 examinations. Table 2, which follows, provides examples of \\nexaminer comments and recommendations related to FPB’s BOD and management.  \\n \\n 7 The FDIC’s amended order granting deposit insurance required that FPB operate within the parameters of \\nthe bank’s business plan submitted to the FDIC and that FPB notify DSC’s Regional Director of proposed \\nmajor deviations or material changes 60 days before consummation of the change.   \\nTable 2:  Examples of Examiner Comments and Recommendations Regarding FPB’s BOD and Management Performance \\nExamination and Visitation Dates \\nExaminer Comments

2007 examination and identified substantial deterioration in FPB’s condition. \\n \\n \\nRisk Management.   FPB did not ensure that adequate risk management controls were \\nimplemented and followed and did not implement corrective actions in a timely manner \\nto adequately address deficiencies identified by examiners and auditors related to the \\nbank’s inadequate risk management controls for loan documentation, administration, and \\nmonitoring.   \\n \\n FPB’s loan policy stated that the bank would avoid concentrations of credit, defined as \\nloans or certain groups of loans which, when aggregated, exceeded 25 percent of the \\nbank’s equity capital and reserves, including combinations of loans secured by types of \\ncollateral that were particularly vulnerable to volatile market conditions.  However, in \\ncontravention of this policy, FPB’s BOD and senior management focused on a strategy of \\naggressively growing the bank’s assets, consisting primarily of high-risk CRE loans with \\na heavy concentration in ADC loans.  As early as the December 2004 examination, FPB’s \\nCRE loans totaled nearly 65 percent of the loan portfolio.  Total assets from June 2004 \\nthrough June 2008 grew, on a cumulative basis, over 516 percent from $41 million to \\nover $258 million, with the majority of the growth occurring in 2004 through 2006—\\nduring FPB’s de novo period.  However, given such growth and an increased risk profile \\nthat resulted from FPB’s BOD and management’s decision to pursue such lending \\nactivity, the bank did not adequately identify, measure, monitor, and report regularly to \\nthe BOD on these concentrations, speculative lending, and interest reserves.   \\n \\nThe September 2007 ROE noted that while FPB had made some improvement, the bank’s \\noverall portfolio risk identification, measuring, monitoring, and reporting practices were \\nineffective.  In fact, inadequate loan documentation and administration were also \\nidentified and reported by examiners in the bank’s last examination report dated May \\n2008.  Specifically, the FDIC’s May 2008 examination concluded that during FPB’s brief \\nhistory, the bank had operated with an aggressive loan growth strategy that included \\npoorly structured and underwritten real-estate-dependent loans in a highly competitive \\nmarket.  The decline in real estate values and construction activity had resulted in many \\nprojects being delayed or abandoned.  Nevertheless, because the bank’s risk management \\nand loan administration practices were inadequate, the BOD was slow to recognize the \\nincreasing risk in FPB’s loan portfolio and lending program as residential real estate \\nvalues started to decline.   \\n \\n \\nInadequate Actions for Apparent Violations of Regulatory Requirements.  \\n Beginning with the bank’s June 2004 examination, examiners cited FPB for apparent \\nviolations of laws and regulations related to loans to directors and officers, appraisals, \\nand minimum capital requirements; contraventions of interagency policies on supervisory \\nloan-to-value limits and ALLL; and noncompliance with regulatory orders.  According to \\nthe DSC Risk Management Manual of Examination Policies (Examination Manual), an \\ninstitution’s BOD and management should implement appropriate policies and \\nprocedures to effect compliance, detect instances of noncompliance, institute corrective \\nmeasures, and provide adequate training and retraining of officers and employees to \\nprevent future infractions.  Further, the Examination Manual states that it is important \\n \\n \\n9 \\n \\nthat the correction of all apparent violations of laws and regulations be instituted \\npromptly, regardless of their perceived importance.   \\n \\nWith respect to the regulatory orders, FPB did not comply with specific conditions \\nincluded in the following: \\n \\n• The FDIC’s Final Order of Approval for Deposit Insurance related to significantly \\ndeviating from the bank’s business plan by exceeding loan growth projections \\nduring the first year of operation without prior notification to the FDIC. \\n \\n• OFR Final Order related to (1) notifying the OFR of FPB’s proposed employment \\nof individuals as executive officers or equivalent positions, (2) providing copies of \\nemployment agreements or contracts, and (3) submitting a revised business plan \\nand financial projections to OFR within the first 6 months of FPB’s operations.   \\n \\nFPB’s BOD and management failed to implement adequate controls to ensure \\ncompliance with laws, regulations, and other regulatory requirements, even though \\napparent violations were reported in each of the bank’s six examinations.   \\n \\n \\nDeviations from FPB’s Business Plan.  Contrary to the FDIC’s final order approving \\nFPB’s deposit insurance, FPB significantly deviated from its business plan by quickly \\nexceeding financial projections and budgets and realizing net losses during its de novo \\nperiod that were significantly higher than planned losses.   In addition, FPB disregarded \\nloan documentation and administration controls that were outlined in its business plan.  \\nFurther, the bank’s business plan indicated that the bank planned to make commercial, \\nresidential, and construction loans, including real estate acquisitions and improvements; \\nhowever, the plan did not provide information regarding FPB’s intentions to concentrate \\nits loan operations in CRE/ADC loans, which can present high risks for institutions, and \\nrapidly expand by opening five branch offices.  FPB also did not follow certain risk \\nmanagement controls outlined in its business plan that impacted its lending policy and \\npractices.   \\n \\nProposed financial institutions are expected to submit business plans with their initial \\napplications for federal deposit insurance.  According to the FDIC Statement of Policy on \\nApplications for Deposit Insurance, and in compliance with sections 5 and 6 of the \\nFDI Act, the FDIC must be assured that the proposed institution does not present an \\nundue risk to the DIF.  The FDIC expects that proposed institutions will submit a \\nbusiness plan commensurate with the capabilities of its management and the financial \\ncommitment of the incorporators.  Any significant deviation from the business plan \\nwithin the first 3 years of operation—the de novo phase—must be reported by the insured \\ndepository institution to the primary federal regulator before consummation of the \\nchange.  Business plans that rely on high-risk lending, a special-purpose market, or \\nsignificant funding from sources other than core deposits, or that otherwise diverge from \\nconventional bank-related financial services, require specific documentation as to the \\nsuitability of the proposed activities for an insured institution.  Similarly, additional \\n \\n \\n10 \\n \\ndocumentation of a business plan is required where markets to be entered are intensely \\ncompetitive or economic conditions are marginal.  Business plans also include \\ninformation on projected financial data for a 3-year period.   \\n \\nSoon after FPB’s opening, examiners concluded that the bank had significantly deviated \\nfrom its business plan and initial financial projections, and FPB’s asset growth had \\nquickly exceeded the revised October 2003 projections.   FPB’s July 2004 revised \\nbusiness plan and financial projections reflected the significant deviations which \\nincluded, but were not limited to (1) increased asset growth, (2) expanding branch office \\noperations, and (3) an additional capital infusion.   In addition, FPB did not follow risk \\nmanagement controls outlined in the bank’s business plan related to its loan portfolio (see \\nTable 3 for examples). \\n \\nTable 3:  FPB’s Business Plan Compared to FPB’s Actions \\nFPB’s Business Plan \\nFPB’s Actions \\nFollow a conservative lending policy that permitted \\nprudent risks.   \\nFPB pursued a liberal lending strategy and relaxed \\nunderwriting practices that included aggressively growing the \\nbank’s CRE/ADC loan portfolio and expanding branch \\noperations. \\n \\n Commit funds to asset products with low loan risk.   \\n \\nFPB aggressively pursued high-risk CRE/ADC loans that \\nsignificantly increased the bank’s risk exposure and ALLL and \\nnegatively impacted earnings and capital.  \\n \\nExercise care and good judgment in underwriting \\nloans (including underwriting loans on the basis of \\nthe borrower’s ability to repay the loan from the cash \\nflow of the business, obtaining appraisals at the time \\nloans are originated, maintaining an adequate ALLL, \\nand limiting the level of classified assets to less than \\n1 percent of the assets).   \\nFPB’s BOD and management failed to ensure that appropriate \\nloan documentation and administration risk management \\ncontrols were implemented and followed, took actions that \\nnegatively affected the quality of the bank’s assets, failed to \\nmaintain an adequate ALLL, and allowed adversely classified \\nassets to exceed 400 percent of total capital prior to failure.   \\n \\n Source:  FPB’s business plan, ROEs, and OIG analysis.  \\n \\n \\nFPB Branch Offices.  FPB’s original business plan was conservative; however, the bank \\nsoon departed from its plan and embarked on an aggressive growth/branching strategy.  \\nOf particular note is the bank’s decision to rapidly expand branch operations.   As \\nindicated in Table 4, applications for three FPB branch offices were submitted, accepted, \\nand approved by the FDIC after its November 2006 examination began, during which \\nsignificant examiner concerns regarding the bank’s compliance with laws and \\nregulations, loan administration and documentation, CRE/ADC concentration, inadequate \\nALLL, inadequate BOD and management performance, deviations from the banks \\nbusiness plan, and weak earnings were reported.   \\n \\n \\n11 \\n \\nTable 4:  FPB Application History and Examiner Concerns \\nApplication Status \\n \\n \\nFPB Branch \\nSubmitted \\nAccepted \\nApproved \\nBranch \\nOffice \\nOpened \\n \\n \\nSignificant Examination Concerns \\n1 \\n8/4/2004 \\n8/20/2004 \\n8/30/2004 \\n2/23/2006 \\nViolations of laws and regulations.   \\nLoan administration and \\ndocumentation deficiencies.  \\nEarnings were weak and resulted in a \\nnet loss.   \\n \\n2 \\n 10/4/2005 \\n10/6/2005 \\n11/4/2005 \\n7/5/2006 \\nViolations of laws and regulations.   \\nLoan administration and \\ndocumentation deficiencies.   \\nExaminers downgraded liquidity. \\n \\n \\n3 \\n12/27/2006 \\n2/1/2007 \\n3/16/2007 \\n4/30/2007 \\n4 \\n12/27/2006 \\n2/1/2007 \\n3/16/2007 \\n5/21/2007 \\n5 \\n3/20/2007 \\n5/3/2007 \\n6/4/2007 \\n7/16/2007 \\nViolations of laws and regulations.   \\n \\nSignificant loan documentation and \\nadministration deficiencies. \\n \\n Decline in FPB’s asset quality, with \\nnoticeable loan portfolio deterioration. \\n \\nFPB’s rapid growth not adequately \\nmonitored or managed by the BOD \\nand management, and the BOD and \\nmanagement needed to improve \\nperformance.   \\n \\n \\n Source:  An FDIC Supervisory History memorandum and ROEs for FPB. \\n \\n \\n During the November 2006 examination, the examiner noted that aggressive branching \\nplans underscored the need to significantly improve the loan review and administration \\nfunctions.   Further, during the examination, the bank’s chief loan officer resigned, \\ncreating additional loan monitoring challenges.  Within its short existence, FPB opened \\nfive branch offices and three loan production offices (LPO) without adequate \\nconsideration of examiner concerns regarding the bank’s loan documentation and \\nadministration and other risk management control weaknesses and inadequate monitoring \\nand management of the bank’s growth.  In addition, FPB’s additional branch offices \\nincreased the bank’s overhead costs; placed additional strain on earnings, which had been \\nhistorically weak; and contributed to the bank’s increasing reliance on non-core deposits \\nto fund its asset growth.   \\n \\n \\nLack of a Comprehensive CLP.  FPB did not implement sound liquidity risk \\nmanagement controls that included a comprehensive CLP.  As a result, when FPB’s \\nasset quality severely deteriorated, the bank’s liquidity position was impacted by \\nnegative publicity related to the bank’s financial condition.  According to the \\n \\n \\n12 \\n \\nExamination Manual, CLPs should be in force and should include strategies for handling \\nliquidity crises and procedures for addressing cash flow shortfalls in emergency \\nsituations.  The manual also states that financial institutions should have an adequate \\nCLP in place to manage and monitor liquidity risk, ensure that an appropriate amount of \\nliquid assets is maintained, measure and project funding requirements during various \\nscenarios, and manage access to funding sources.   \\n \\n FPB demonstrated warning indicators that should have prompted FPB of the need for a \\ncomprehensive CLP and increased monitoring of the bank’s liquidity position by the \\nbank’s BOD and management.   For example, FPB exhibited indicators such as: \\n \\n• \\nrapid asset growth funded,  \\n• \\na decline in earnings performance or projections, \\n• \\na decline in asset quality, and  \\n• \\nreal or perceived negative publicity. \\n \\nThe FDIC issued Financial Institution Letter—FIL-59-2003—entitled, Use of the \\nFederal Reserve’s Primary Credit Program in Effective Liquidity Management, dated \\nJuly 23, 2003, which provides interagency guidance on the need for financial institutions \\nto develop CLPs, in addition to other liquidity risk management controls, and informs \\ndepository institutions that a contingency plan should be part of the bank’s liquidity \\nmanagement program.   In addition, the Examination Manual includes 13 suggested \\nelements that should be included in CLPs.  However, FPB’s CLP included only 3 of \\nthose 13 elements.   FPB’s CLP identified sources of funding but did not identify the \\nconditions related to their use and circumstances where the institution might use them.  \\n For example, the CLP did not: \\n \\n• \\ndefine responsibilities and decision-making authority,  \\n• \\ninclude an assessment of the possible liquidity events that an institution might \\nencounter, \\n• \\ndetail how management would monitor for liquidity events, and  \\n• \\nidentify and assess the adequacy of contingent funding sources.   \\n \\n Further, FPB’s CLP was not diversified to allow consideration of potential providers of \\nfunds and the underlying stability, availability, and flexibility of funding sources.   \\n \\nFPB’s BOD and management had failed to implement adequate controls to monitor the \\nbank’s liquidity risk.  The September 2007 examination identified significant \\ndeterioration in FPB’s loan portfolio, a high level of adverse classifications, significant \\ndowngrades in loans from the bank’s internal watch list, and an inadequate ALLL.   After \\nOctober 2007, FPB’s asset liability committee failed to monitor, strategize, and \\notherwise plan for FPB’s liquidity needs, even though the bank’s financial condition was \\nseverely deteriorating.   \\n \\n \\n \\n13 \\n \\nFPB’s loan portfolio deterioration became even more critical after the bank’s September \\n2007 examination, which identified significant deterioration in FPB’s asset quality. \\nFPB’s liquidity position was monitored solely by the chief financial officer, who \\nmanaged the bank’s liquidity by focusing almost exclusively on maintaining sufficient \\nliquidity to avert a crisis.  As FPB’s financial position continued to deteriorate due to \\npoor asset quality, the bank’s liquidity position was adversely affected.  Specifically, \\nFPB’s net interest margin declined, and earnings and capital positions were adversely \\naffected.  In addition, FPB was required to pledge investment securities to secure the \\nbank’s lines of credit.  Further, the bank lacked adequate controls and potential sources \\nto address liquidity shortfalls and the resultant crises, and negative publicity impacted \\nthe bank’s liquidity position.   \\n \\n \\nRegulatory Supervision Related to Management \\n \\n According to the Examination Manual, the quality of management is probably the single \\nmost important element in the successful operation of a bank.  The BOD is responsible \\nfor formulating sound policies and objectives for the bank, effective supervision of its \\naffairs, and promotion of its welfare, while the primary responsibility of senior \\nmanagement is implementing the BOD’s policies and objectives in the bank’s day-to-day \\noperations.  Also according to the manual, the capability and performance of \\nmanagement and the BOD is rated based upon, but not limited to, an assessment of \\ncompliance with laws and regulations.   \\n \\nGenerally, FPB provided written responses to each examination and promised corrective \\nactions, and examiners generally followed up on any recommendations at the next \\nexamination.  However, in response to the 2006 examination, the FDIC followed up with \\nFPB between examinations, requiring FPB to provide information on addressing the 2006 \\nexamination loan administration and documentation issues and improving earnings (both \\nmanagement and earnings were rated 3 at the 2006 examination).   In its response to the \\nFDIC on January 29, 2007, FPB stated it had taken steps to hire new management, \\nincluding a chief credit officer and commercial loan portfolio manager; increased the loan \\ndepartment staff; and initiated actions to improve loan administration.  Although the \\nFDIC accepted FPB’s response, FPB failed to implement actions to sufficiently address \\nthe 2006 examination results and to prevent the continued deterioration of FPB’s \\nfinancial condition.   \\n \\n In addition, according to the DSC Case Manager Procedures Manual, the risk posed by \\nany particular institution is a function of the business plan pursued, management’s \\ncompetency in administering the institution’s affairs, and the quality and implementation \\nof risk management programs.  Regarding FPB’s business plan, examiner concerns \\nseemed to focus on the bank’s financial projections and did not include an assessment of \\nFPB’s planned business strategy and risk management controls compared to the bank’s \\nactual practices.  Although DSC required FPB to provide updated financial and budget \\ndata, DSC did not require FPB to provide a revised business plan that addressed the \\nbank’s concentrations in CRE/ADC loans that presented high risks to the bank and the \\n \\n \\n14 \\n \\nbank’s plan to mitigate such risk through appropriate loan documentation, administration, \\nand lending strategies.   \\n \\nRegarding FPB’s branch office activities, examiners downgraded FPB’s management and \\nearnings ratings from 2 to 3 and downgraded asset quality from 1 to 2 as a result of the \\n2006 examination.  According to the DSC Case Manager Procedures Manual, an \\napplication can be removed from expedited processing if DSC determines that the bank’s \\napplication presents significant supervisory concerns, including a management rating \\nof 3.  Accordingly, after the November 2006 examination, the FDIC removed three FPB \\nbranch applications (for FPB’s third, fourth, and fifth branch offices) from the expedited \\napproval process because the BOD and management had not: \\n \\n• \\nstaffed loan operations and review properly while focusing on rapid growth, \\nwhich had resulted in numerous administrative deficiencies and inadequate \\nportfolio monitoring systems; \\n \\n• \\nadequately funded the ALLL; \\n \\n• \\nprovided sufficient internal audit oversight; and \\n \\n• \\nimplemented examiner recommendations in a timely manner.   \\n \\nThe FDIC’s decision-making process for FPB’s branch applications included an \\nassessment of FPB’s financial data and branching strategy.  In addition, pursuant to \\nsections 5 and 6 of the FDI Act, DSC officials evaluated FPB’s applications for branch \\noffices to conclude on the: \\n \\n• \\nfinancial history and condition of FPB, \\n• \\nadequacy of FPB’s capital structure, \\n• \\nfuture earnings prospects, \\n• \\ngeneral character and fitness of bank management, \\n• \\nrisk to the DIF, and  \\n• \\nconvenience and needs of the community to be served.   \\n \\n DSC officials also evaluated the applications to determine whether FPB’s corporate \\npowers were consistent with the purposes of the FDI Act. \\n \\nBefore the FDIC approved FPB’s applications for its third and fourth branch offices, the \\nFDIC proactively required FPB to respond to the November 2006 examination \\ndeficiencies, submit revised financial projections reflecting the proposed branches, and \\ndiscuss the bank’s earnings improvement plan.   In its response, FPB projected net income \\nof $263,000, which DSC considered realistic.   In addition, FPB stated that in August \\n2006, FPB had hired a chief credit officer, who was expected to have a positive impact on \\ncredit administration and portfolio monitoring systems, and hired a new senior lender in \\nDecember 2006.  Additionally, the BOD stated its commitment to correct the weaknesses \\nnoted in the ROE and provided corrective action plans to address the weaknesses.   \\n \\n \\n \\n15 \\n \\nRegarding FPB’s application for its fifth branch office, the FDIC requested FPB to \\nprovide a copy of the bank’s strategic/business plans for 2007 and 2008, including \\nassumptions and branching plans; supporting assumptions for the 2007 budget; and \\ncopies of CRE loan concentration reports provided to the BOD.  The FDIC reviewed \\nFPB’s revised financial projections, which included the three branches in 2007 and a \\nconservatively maintained ALLL throughout the 2-year period and reflected a nominal \\nloss of $28,000 in 2007 and net income of $693,000 in 2008.  However, from the time \\nFPB responded to the FDIC’s concerns related to the third and fourth branch offices to its \\nresponse for the fifth branch, the bank’s net income projections for 2007 had changed \\nfrom $263,000 to a projected net loss of $28,000—a decrease of $291,000.   \\n \\n Nevertheless, the FDIC concluded that: \\n \\n• \\nFPB’s business plan anticipated that future earnings opportunities would be \\nenhanced by accessing new markets and lowering its cost of funds with new retail \\ndeposits generated by the branches;  \\n \\n• \\nthe bank’s CRE loan report reflected improved monitoring; and  \\n \\n• \\nFPB’s capital was sufficient to support the business plan with projected Tier 1 \\nLeverage Capital Ratios of 10.3 percent at the end of 2007 and 8.4 percent at the \\nend of 2008.  \\n \\nAdditionally, FPB committed to the FDIC that it had no additional branching plans \\nthrough 2008.  However, soon after FPB’s last branch office opened on July 16, 2007, the \\nFDIC’s offsite analysis and follow-up visitation conducted in July and August 2007, \\nrespectively, identified significant deterioration in FPB’s financial condition, earnings, \\nand asset quality; and loan documentation and administration deficiencies, indicating \\nineffective corrective actions to address prior examiner concerns and FPB’s deficient risk \\nmanagement controls.  Further, the FDIC assessed FPB’s branch applications based on \\nstatutory requirements and delayed application approvals; however, the actions taken and \\npromised by FPB ultimately did not resolve examiner concerns, overall operational \\ndeficiencies, or earnings performance issues (see Table 2).   \\n \\nPrevious guidance related to business plans did not provide a definition of significant \\ndeviations; accordingly, in June 2008, DSC’s ARO issued guidance for determining what \\nconstitutes a major deviation or material change in business plans for de novo institutions \\nduring the first 3 years of operation.  That guidance states that examiners should consider \\nwhether changes have occurred in growth levels, asset and liability mix or products \\noffered, and plans for branch offices or LPOs.   \\n \\nAlthough FPB had not developed a comprehensive CLP, examiners did not recommend \\nthat the bank review and revise its CLP to adequately address the 13 plan elements listed \\nin the Examination Manual.  FPB had not developed controls that could have identified \\nthe specific circumstances under which secondary sources of funds should be used and \\nthe manner in which those funds would be used to provide liquidity for the bank.   \\n \\n \\n \\n16 \\n \\nSubsequent to FPB’s failure, DSC issued additional guidance related to liquidity risk and \\nCLPs.  The FDIC’s Liquidity Risk Management guidance, dated August 26, 2008, urges \\nthe financial institution BOD to establish a formal CLP that establishes quantitative \\nliquidity risk guidelines.  The guidance also states that CLPs should identify the \\ninstitution’s liquidity risk profile and the types of stress events that may be faced \\nincluding, but not limited to, a deterioration in asset quality, becoming less than well \\ncapitalized, the need to fund unplanned asset growth, loss of access to market funding \\nsources, and the impact of negative press coverage.  The guidance also reiterates many of \\nthe CLP elements that FPB’s CLP did not include, as discussed earlier.   \\n \\n \\nASSET QUALITY \\n \\nFPB’s asset quality was rated 1 at its 2004 and 2005 examinations.  At subsequent \\nexaminations, FPB’s asset quality rating was progressively downgraded, indicating that \\nthe bank’s level of risk and problem assets were significant and inadequately controlled \\nand subjected the bank to potential losses that threatened the viability of the institution.  \\nBy the May 2008 examination, examiners concluded that FPB’s asset quality or credit \\nadministration practices were critically deficient and presented an imminent threat to the \\ninstitution’s viability.   \\n \\nFPB’s asset quality deteriorated as total adversely classified items increased to over \\n$65.7 million in 2008.  In particular, loan classifications significantly increased, from \\n$5.7 million in 2006 to over $60.1 million in 2008.  Corresponding increases in the FPB’s \\nadversely classified loans and ALLL were also significant (see Table 5).   At the \\nNovember 2006 examination, adversely classified loans represented 15.66 percent of \\ncapital, and by May 2008, adversely classified loans totaled more than 403 percent of \\ncapital.   \\n \\nTable 5:  FPB Asset Classifications and ALLL \\n \\nAsset Quality \\n(Dollars in Thousands) \\nAsset Classifications \\nAnalysis of ALLL \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nExamination \\nDate \\n \\n \\n \\nSubstandard \\n \\n \\n \\nDoubtful \\n \\n \\n \\nLoss \\n \\nTotal \\nClassified \\nItems \\n \\nALLL \\nComputed by \\nFPB \\nIncrease in \\nALLL  \\nRequired by \\nExaminers \\n \\nJune 04 \\n0 \\n0 \\n0 \\n0 \\n$80 \\n0 \\nDec 04 \\n0 \\n0 \\n0 \\n0 \\n$398 \\n0 \\nNov 05 \\n0 \\n0 \\n0 \\n0 \\n$1,201 \\n0 \\nNov 06 \\n$4,649 \\n$25 \\n$1,061 \\n$5,735 \\n$2,640 \\n$1,100 \\nSept 07 \\n$41,474 \\n0 \\n$3,232 \\n$44,706 \\n$3,606 \\n$6,100 \\nMay 08 \\n$58,240 \\n$392 \\n$7,086 \\n$65,718 \\n$8,468 \\n$3,400 \\nSource:  ROEs for FPB.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n17 \\n \\n In addition to identification of the $5.7 million in adversely classified assets at the 2006 \\nexamination, examiners identified another $4.6 million in assets as “Special Mention,” \\nreferring to loans that had potential weaknesses that deserved management’s close \\nattention and, if left uncorrected, could result in deterioration of the status of those assets. \\n \\n \\nExaminer Concerns and Recommendations Regarding Asset Quality \\n \\nExaminer concerns regarding FPB’s asset quality related to its concentration in high-risk \\nCRE/ADC loans and the bank’s lack of adequate loan documentation and administration \\n(see Table 6, which follows).

CRE loans totaled more than 228 percent of Tier 1 capital. \\n \\n • \\nSeptember 2006.  CRE exposure totaled 127 percent of Tier 1 Leverage Capital.  \\nIncluding multi-family and other non-farm nonresidential loans increased the \\nbank’s risk exposure to 342 percent of Tier 1 Leverage Capital.  Further, \\nexaminers noted that the degree of exposure was likely underreported because the \\nbank recognized that an undetermined amount of loans might need to be \\nreclassified as CRE loans.  \\n \\n • \\nJune 2007.  CRE loans represented 388 percent of total capital.  Of that amount, \\nADC loans comprised 49 percent of all CRE loans and were equal to 190 percent \\nof total capital—nearly double the benchmark for further supervisory review.  \\nClassified assets were 129 percent of Tier 1 Capital and the ALLL, which was \\ndeficient by $6.1 million.   Additionally, loans totaling a substantial $15.2 million \\nwere downgraded and adversely classified, and loans totaling an additional \\n$9 million were not on FPB’s internal watch list.  \\n \\n • \\nMay 2008.  The level of concentration was extremely high given the fact that the \\nbank was critically undercapitalized and the amount of CRE loans was significant.   \\n \\n On December 12, 2006, the federal banking agencies issued joint guidance on CRE \\nlending entitled, Guidance on Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound \\nRisk Management Practices.  According to the guidance, the FDIC and the other federal \\nbanking agencies acknowledged that a concentration in CRE loans, coupled with weak \\nloan underwriting and depressed CRE markets, has contributed to significant loan \\nlosses.8   \\n \\nHowever, FPB focused and concentrated its loan portfolio in CRE/ADC loans, which \\nincreased its level of risk, and failed to ensure that adequate risk management controls \\nwere developed and implemented.  Examiners recommended several actions to mitigate \\nthe bank’s CRE risk.  However, bank management failed to implement actions to \\nadequately address those recommendations, and asset quality continued to decline.  \\n Further, beginning with the November 2006 examination, and continuing through the \\nMay 2008 examination, examiners identified a high level of adverse classifications along \\nwith significant downgrades of classified loans, an inadequate ALLL methodology, and \\n                                                           \\n8 The FDIC also issued FIL 22-2008 on March 17, 2008, entitled, Managing Commercial Real Estate \\nConcentrations in a Challenging Environment, which re-emphasized the importance of strong capital and \\nALLL and loan risk-management practices for state nonmember institutions with significant CRE and \\nconstruction and development loan concentrations.   \\n \\n \\n 20 \\n \\ninadequately funded ALLL.  As asset quality declined and losses were properly \\nrecognized, FPB’s liquidity position became deficient, and earnings and capital were \\neroded.   \\n \\n \\n Interest Reserves.  FPB did not have appropriate controls related to the use and \\nreporting of interest reserves.  FPB’s December 8, 2003 loan policy stated the bank \\nshould include provisions in the loan agreement that provide for the discontinuation of \\nfunding of the interest reserve in the event the project falls behind projected performance \\ngoals.  However, FPB did not always follow this policy in that management extended or \\nre-funded the interest reserves for many loans.  In addition, FPB did not maintain \\ncomplete records on the extent and number of loans funded with interest reserves or the \\nextent of loans for which interest reserves had been funded multiple times.  Through \\nreconstruction of FPB records, the OIG determined that FPB used about $8.9 million in \\ninterest reserves to fund loans.  Of that amount, $4.5 million (about 51 percent) was \\nassociated with FPB’s adversely classified loans.  The use of interest reserves helped to \\nmask the deterioration of these loans.   \\n \\nDSC has issued guidance on the use of interest reserves.  In November 2007, the ARO \\nissued guidance entitled, Identification and Analysis of Interest Reserves at Risk \\nManagement Examinations.   In April 2008, DSC issued examiner guidance reiterating \\nthe November 2007 ARO guidance.  In addition, in June 2008, DSC issued guidance to \\nexaminers and FDIC-supervised financial institutions on the use of interest reserves that \\ndescribes the use of interest reserves in ADC lending, examines the risk this underwriting \\npractice could present, and identifies “red flags” that should alert lenders to potential \\nproblems at each stage of the ADC cycle.   \\n \\n \\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses.  FPB’s methodology for determining the ALLL \\ndid not comply with interagency policy.  According to the Interagency Policy Statement \\non the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (FIL-105-2006), dated December 13, 2006, \\neach institution must analyze the collectibility of its loans and maintain an ALLL at a \\nlevel that is appropriate and determined to be in accordance with Generally Accepted \\nAccounting Principles (GAAP).9  An appropriate ALLL covers estimated loan losses on \\nindividually evaluated loans that are determined to be impaired as well as estimated loan \\nlosses inherent in the remainder of the loan and lease portfolio.   \\n \\n                                                           \\n9 Interagency Policy Statement on the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (FIL-105-2006), dated \\nDecember 13, 2006.  The federal banking agencies originally issued a 1993 policy statement that described \\nthe responsibilities of the BOD and management of banks and savings associations and of examiners \\nregarding the ALLL.   The December 2006 policy reiterated that guidance and made the policy applicable to \\ncredit unions.   Further, the policy provides key concepts and requirements pertaining to the ALLL included \\nin GAAP and existing supervisory guidance and describes the nature and purpose of the ALLL; the \\nresponsibilities of BODs, management, and examiners; factors to be considered in the estimation of the \\nALLL; and the objectives and elements of an effective loan review system, including a sound loan grading \\nsystem. \\n \\n \\n21 \\n \\nAlthough the November 2006 examination concluded that FPB’s ALLL methodology \\nwas adequate, examiners recommended that FPB increase the ALLL by $1.1 million due \\nto adversely classified loans that totaled $5.7 million.  However, in subsequent \\nexaminations, examiners’ conclusions regarding the adequacy of the ALLL methodology \\nchanged.  Specifically, examiners concluded that FPB’s ALLL methodology did not \\ncomply with interagency guidance included in FIL-105-2006.  Examiners recommended \\nsignificant increases in FPB’s ALLL to compensate for FPB’s inaccurate methodology \\nand to provide for the increased amount of adversely classified loans examiners \\nidentified.   \\n \\n • \\nAt the follow-up visitation in August 2007, adversely classified items totaled \\n$45 million, representing 129 percent of Tier 1 Capital and ALLL.   Of the \\n$45 million, $15.2 million represented adversely classified loans that were \\ndowngraded from FPB’s internal watch list, and $9 million represented adversely \\nclassified loans that bank management had not included on the watch list.  As a \\nresult, the ALLL had a shortfall of $6.1 million. \\n \\n • \\nThe May 2008 examination determined that adversely classified assets, including \\n$60.1 million in loans, had increased to $65.7 million, representing 403 percent of \\nTier 1 Capital and ALLL, resulting in a shortfall of $3.4 million in ALLL.   \\n \\nExaminers determined that shortages in ALLL could be attributable to the bank’s slow \\nidentification of problem loans and to an ineffective ALLL methodology that failed to \\nfollow the interagency policy on ALLL and GAAP.  As FPB’s assets deteriorated and the \\nneed to substantially increase the ALLL became apparent, earnings and capital were \\nsignificantly impacted.  FPB reported net losses for almost each year of operation (see \\nTable 7).   \\n \\nTable 7:  FPB Net Income or Loss (Dollars in Thousands)  \\n2003 \\n2004 \\n2005 \\n2006 \\n2007 \\n2008* \\n($432) \\n($961) \\n$19 \\n($546) \\n($18,997) \\n(12,448) \\n Source:  FPB December 31st UBPR data for each year, except as noted for 2008. \\n * Data is as of June 30, 2008 UBPR Report.   \\n \\n \\nAccording to the FDIC’s documentation on FPB’s applications, revised financial \\nprojections provided by FPB reflected that FPB expected a nominal loss of $28,000 for \\n2007 and showed a net income of $693,000 for 2008.   However, as indicated in Table 7, \\nthe financial projections were grossly inaccurate.  Further, during the exit meeting with \\nOFR examiners after the bank’s September 2007 examination, FPB officials attributed \\nthe bank’s earnings problem to the bank’s strategy for new branch offices at a time when \\nthe real estate market began to decline and stated that the lack of earnings was a “self-\\ninflicted” problem.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n22 \\n \\nRegulatory Supervision Related to Asset Quality \\n \\n FPB’s loan administration deficiencies should have warranted greater supervisory \\nconcern during the November 2006 examination when FPB was still in a de novo status \\nand had experienced significant growth in its loan portfolio between 2004 and 2006.   In \\naddition, FPB exhibited the following risk factors that DSC has determined to be \\nassociated with de novo institutions: \\n \\n• \\ninexperienced management and/or high turnover, \\n• \\nweak oversight by the BOD, \\n• \\nrapid asset growth, and \\n• \\na dominant BOD member.   \\n \\nFPB’s BOD and management aggressively grew its loan portfolio although the bank had \\nnot adequately identified, measured, monitored, or controlled risks; including \\nimplementing actions to address examiner concerns related to loan documentation and \\nadministration deficiencies.   Specifically, as a result of the 2006 examination, DSC \\nconcluded that FPB’s loan portfolio had begun to deteriorate noticeably and was highly \\nconcentrated in CRE/ADC loans, which presented a higher risk for the bank ; loan \\nadministration issues, which had been identified as early as the 2004 examination and by \\ninternal auditors in 2004 and 2005, remained uncorrected or in need of improvement.  \\nDSC also concluded that FPB’s risk profile was increasing.   \\n \\n According to the Examination Manual, the asset quality rating reflects the quantity of \\nexisting and potential credit risk associated with the loan and investment portfolios, and \\nother assets.  The ability of management to identify, measure, monitor, and control credit \\nrisk and the evaluation of the adequacy of the ALLL are also reflected in the asset quality \\nrating.  The Examination Manual provides guidance on which rating level is appropriate \\nbased on issues identified by examiners.  For example, the Examination Manual states \\nthat a rating of 3 is assigned when: \\n \\n• \\nAsset quality or credit administration practices are less than satisfactory and there \\nis a general need to improve those practices.   \\n \\n• \\nTrends may be stable or indicate deterioration in asset quality or an increase in \\nrisk exposure. \\n \\n • \\nThe level and severity of classified assets, other weaknesses, and risks require an \\nelevated level of supervisory concern. \\n \\nAt the November 2006 FDIC examination, examiners assessed the condition of the \\nbank’s loan portfolio and concluded that asset quality was satisfactory; however, \\nnoticeable loan portfolio deterioration had occurred since the prior examination.  \\nAdversely classified loans exceeded $5.7 million, which represented 15.66 percent of \\nTier 1 Leverage Capital.   In addition, loans cited as Special Mention for their \\nunderwriting deficiencies exceeded $4.6 million.  Collectively, $10.3 million in criticized \\n \\n \\n23 \\n \\nloans represented 28.31 percent of Tier 1 Leverage Capital.  Examiners also concluded \\nthat, while the level and severity of classified loans was low in relation to capital, \\nnoticeable loan portfolio deterioration had occurred since the last examination.  \\nExaminers also noted that the emergence of substandard and loss loans in the bank’s third \\nyear of operations was unusual and reflected increased significance given the elevated \\nand increasing risk profile of the institution and the bank’s pattern of weak underwriting \\npractices.  As a result, examiners made several recommendations to improve FPB’s risk \\nmanagement for CRE/ADC loans (see Tables 2 and 6).   \\n \\nIn addition, at the 2006 examination, although examiners concluded that FPB’s \\nmethodology for determining the adequacy of the ALLL was adequate, examiners also \\nconcluded that, based on the significant amount of adversely classified loans, FPB would \\nneed to increase the ALLL by up to $1.1 million by December 31, 2006.   \\n \\nFurther, at the November 2006 examination, examiners noted that risk management \\npolicies and practices for the loan function were not adequate and identified numerous \\nloan administration shortcomings that appeared to be systemic in nature.  Despite modest \\nimprovements since the prior examination related to loan documentation and \\nadministration weaknesses, the examiners emphasized the need for further improvement.  \\nFor example, the ALLL was inadequate, a significant number of loan files were found to \\nbe deficient, and exceptions to supervisory loan-to-value guidelines reported to the BOD \\neach quarter were found to improperly exclude certain loans.   \\n \\nHowever, the examiners’ evaluation of FPB’s asset quality at the November 2006 \\nexamination was based on the total of adversely classified loans—15.66 percent of Tier 1 \\nLeverage Capital—and did not consider the systemic nature of deficiencies in loan \\ndocumentation and administration or a qualitative assessment of the bank’s elevated CRE \\nrisk exposure, which the examiner concluded might adversely impact the bank’s financial \\ncondition.  DSC officials stated that the loan documentation and administration \\ndeficiencies identified during the 2006 examination were addressed in the examiners’ \\ndecision to downgrade FPB’s management to 3 and asset quality to 2. \\n \\nAfter the November 2006 examination, DSC’s offsite monitoring of FPB’s condition in \\nJuly 2007 reflected a significant increase in past due and nonaccrual loans and additional \\ncharge-offs based on March 31, 2007 financial data.  Although FPB’s earnings continued \\nto be weak, the bank was scheduled to open three branch offices in 2007.  As a result of \\nthese concerns, the DSC regional office requested the DSC field office to conduct a \\ntargeted visitation to review the actions taken by FPB management to: \\n \\n• \\ncorrect the deficiencies noted in the prior FDIC examination, \\n• \\nanalyze loans charged off and increases in past due loans, \\n• \\nreview earnings, and \\n• \\nreview risk management practices over the bank’s significant real estate exposure. \\n \\nShortly after the visitation began, the examiner noted significant deterioration in the loan \\nportfolio that prompted the OFR to accelerate its scheduled full-scope examination, \\n \\n \\n24 \\n \\nwhich was conducted in September 2007.  The FDIC also issued a problem bank \\nmemorandum in January 2008.   \\n \\nOn February 8, 2008, the OFR and the FDIC jointly issued an MOU10 to FPB.  The \\nMOU, among other things, required FPB to: \\n \\n• \\nIncrease the BOD’s participation in the supervision of the bank’s operations. \\n• \\nObtain qualified management and staffing for the loan department. \\n• \\nImprove asset quality. \\n • \\nAmend loan and other policies to establish:  \\no \\nstronger, appropriate loan concentration guidelines for all loan types; \\no \\nprocedures and criteria for approving loan policy exceptions; \\no \\nguidelines for establishing and monitoring interest reserves, appropriate \\nloan-to-value limits, and determining realistic collateral values; \\no \\nspecific criteria for the use of interest-only loans with balloon payments; \\no \\ncomprehensive ADC loan risk management systems; and  \\no \\nrequirements for obtaining current financial statements and/or tax returns \\nfor borrowers and guarantors and ensuring insurance coverage on any \\ncollateral. \\n• \\nDevelop a written plan to monitor concentrations of risk in relation to total capital \\nthat included:  appropriate limits for concentrations of credit by industry, product \\nline, type of collateral, and borrower; and establish limits and identify the risks \\nassociated with the concentration of CRE loans.   \\n \\nAlthough the 2008 MOU addressed issues related to FPB’s asset quality and loan \\nadministration and documentation, greater concern during the 2006 examination, \\nregarding the severity of these deficiencies and FPB’s history of not adequately \\naddressing these issues for more than 2 years, could have led to elevated supervisory \\nattention and earlier supervisory action. \\n \\n \\nIMPLEMENTATION OF PCA \\n \\nThe purpose of PCA is to resolve problems of insured depository institutions at the least \\npossible long-term cost to the DIF.  PCA establishes a system of restrictions and \\nmandatory and discretionary supervisory actions that are to be triggered depending on an \\ninstitution’s capital levels.  Part 325 of the FDIC’s Rules and Regulations implements \\nPCA requirements by establishing a framework for taking prompt corrective action \\nagainst insured nonmember banks that are not adequately capitalized.   \\n \\nThe FDIC evaluated FPB’s capital position; assigned capital component ratings; included \\ncapital-related provisions in informal and formal actions, including a PCA Directive, in \\n                                                           \\n10 The OFR and FDIC initially considered issuing a Cease and Desist Order (C&D) against FPB.  However, \\nin the decision-making process regarding the type of supervisory action to impose, OFR considered actions \\ntaken by FPB’s new management to address the bank’s financial condition and asset quality-related issues \\nand decided to issue an MOU rather than a C&D.  The MOU included the same provisions that had been \\nproposed for the C&D.   \\n \\n \\n25 \\n \\naccordance with regulatory guidelines; and provided PCA notification letters.   The \\nFDIC’s November 2005 examination concluded that FPB’s declining trend in capital \\nratios was a result of the bank’s asset growth and that, in order to remain well capitalized \\ngiven its significant growth rate, FPB had raised additional capital through a second stock \\noffering.  In fact, FPB’s rapid growth from 2003 to 2006—the bank’s de novo period—\\nwas supported by significant stock issuances to raise more than $35 million in capital, as \\nshown in Table 8 below.   \\n \\n Table 8:  FPB Capital Stock Issuances \\n2003 \\n2004 \\n2005 \\n2006 \\n2007 \\n \\n($000) \\nCommon Stock Issued \\n$8,616 \\n$144 \\n$8,192 \\n$18,345 \\n$0 \\nCumulative \\n$8,616 \\n$8,760 \\n$16,952 \\n$35,297 \\n$35,297 \\nSource:  An FDIC Supervisory History memorandum.  \\n \\n \\n As of December 31, 2007, DSC officials concluded that FPB’s capital position had \\ndeteriorated and, considering FPB’s decline in capital, excessive level of problem assets, \\nsignificant concentration in CRE loans relative to capital, and questionable earning \\nprospects, the institution’s capital was considered to be marginal.   On February 8, 2008, \\nthe FDIC and OFR jointly issued an MOU.  The MOU included provisions related to \\ncapital and required FPB to:  \\n \\n• \\nSubmit, within 60 days, a capital plan for maintaining a Tier 1 Capital ratio of no \\nless than 8 percent.  The plan, at a minimum, was to address FPB’s current and \\nfuture capital requirements, including the maintenance of adequate risk-based and \\nTier 1 Capital ratios; the volume of FPB’s adversely classified and problem \\nassets; the bank’s anticipated level of earnings; and the source and timing of \\nadditional funds to fulfill future ALLL and capital requirements.   \\n \\n• \\nDevelop a written capital plan acceptable to the OFR and FDIC to enable the bank \\nto monitor concentrations of risk in relation to total capital. \\n \\nIn its Consolidated Report of Condition and Income (Call) Report, dated December 31, \\n2007, FPB reported that it held brokered deposits totaling $13.5 million.   On March 14, \\n2008, the FDIC issued a letter restricting FPB’s use of brokered deposits because FPB’s \\ncapital category fell below the well capitalized category.  In response to the FDIC’s letter, \\nFPB notified the FDIC that it had not rolled over or renewed any brokered deposits. \\n \\n On May 1, 2008, the FDIC notified FPB that based on its March 31, 2008 Call Report \\ndata, FPB was considered to be significantly undercapitalized for PCA purposes.   The \\nFDIC required FPB to develop and submit a capital restoration plan (CRP) within \\n45 days of April 30, 2008.  The plan was to provide information on: \\n \\n \\n26 \\n \\n• \\nsteps the bank would take to become adequately capitalized; \\n \\n• \\nlevels of capital to be attained during each year in which the plan would be in \\neffect; \\n \\n• \\nhow the bank would comply with the restrictions and requirements related to asset \\ngrowth restrictions and prior approval of acquisitions, new branches, and new \\nlines of business; and  \\n \\n• \\ntypes and levels of activities in which the bank would engage.   \\n \\n The bank submitted its CRP on June 6, 2008, which the FDIC reviewed and requested \\nFPB to update.   On June 25, 2008, the FDIC issued a PCA Directive.  Mandatory actions \\nincluded the submission of another CRP and restrictions on asset growth, acquisitions, \\nnew activities, new branches, payment of dividends or making any other capital \\ndistribution, or payment of management fees.   \\n \\nPCA’s focus is on capital, and capital can be a lagging indicator of an institution’s \\nfinancial health.   In addition, the use of PCA Directives depends on the accuracy of \\ncapital ratios in a financial institution’s Call Reports.  FPB’s capital remained in the well \\ncapitalized to adequately capitalized range long after its operations had begun to \\ndeteriorate because of problems related to management, asset quality, risk management \\ncontrols, and net losses.  In particular, the ALLL was significantly underfunded which \\noverstated capital and underreported the deterioration of the loan portfolio.   \\n \\n FPB’s efforts to comply with the MOU to improve the bank’s condition and raise \\nadditional capital proved unsuccessful.   Further, by the time FPB’s capital level fell \\nbelow the required threshold necessary to implement PCA, the bank’s condition had \\ndeteriorated to the point at which the institution could not raise additional needed capital, \\nestimated to total $30 million, through its BOD or find other investors to assist in \\ncapitalizing the bank.   \\n \\n \\nCORPORATION COMMENTS \\n \\nOn February 12, 2009, the Director, DSC, provided a written response to the draft report.  \\nDSC’s response is provided in its entirety as Appendix 3 of this report.  In its response, \\nDSC agreed with the OIG’s conclusions regarding the causes of FPB’s failure and the \\nresulting material loss to the DIF, and DSC’s supervisory activities related to FPB.   DSC \\nalso agreed that the November 2006 examination results related to the loan \\ndocumentation and administration deficiencies should have warranted greater supervisory \\naction.   \\n \\nDSC also stated that it has undertaken a number of initiatives related to the supervision of \\nfinancial institutions that have high-risk lending activities, including concentrations in \\nCRE and/or the use of interest reserves.  Additionally in December 2008, DSC conducted \\n \\n \\n27 \\n \\non-site visitations of certain financial institutions that resulted in downgraded ratings and \\ninitiating corrective programs.   \\n \\nIt should be noted the OIG did not conclude on specific examination ratings or \\nsupervisory actions.  Rather, we evaluated the FDIC’s overall supervision of the \\ninstitution.  In this regard, we concluded that greater supervisory concern was warranted \\nas a result of the 2006 examination due to the deficiencies identified, the de novo status \\nof the institution, and its increasing risk profile.   \\n \\n \\n28 \\nAPPENDIX 1 \\nOBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND METHODOLOGY \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n29 \\nObjectives \\n \\nWe performed this audit in accordance with section 38(k) of the FDI Act, which provides \\nthat if a deposit insurance fund incurs a material loss with respect to an insured \\ndepository institution, the Inspector General of the appropriate federal banking agency \\nshall prepare a report to that agency, reviewing the agency’s supervision of the \\ninstitution.  The FDI Act requires that the report be completed within 6 months after it \\nbecomes apparent that a material loss has been incurred.   \\n \\nOur audit objectives were to (1) determine the causes of the financial institution’s failure \\nand resulting material loss to the DIF and (2) evaluate the FDIC’s supervision of the \\ninstitution, including implementation of the PCA provisions of section 38.   \\n \\nWe conducted the audit from August 2008 to January 2009 in accordance with generally \\naccepted government auditing standards.  However, due to the limited scope and \\nobjectives established for material loss reviews, which are generally applied to just one \\nfinancial institution , it was not feasible to address certain aspects of the standards, as \\ndescribed on the next page.   \\n \\n \\n Scope and Methodology \\n \\nThe scope of this audit included an analysis of FPB’s operations, which opened on \\nDecember 8, 2003, until its failure on August 1, 2008.  Our review also entailed an \\nevaluation of the regulatory supervision of the institution over the same period and the \\napplication process for FPB.   \\n \\nTo achieve the audit objectives, we performed the following procedures and techniques: \\n \\n• Analyzed examination and visitation reports and examination work papers \\nprepared by the FDIC and the State of Florida’s Office of Financial Regulation \\nexaminers from 2004 to 2008.   \\n \\n• Reviewed the following: \\n• Bank data and correspondence maintained at the DSC’s ARO and Tampa \\nField Office.   \\n \\n• Reports prepared by the Division of Resolutions and Receiverships (DRR) \\nand DSC relating to the bank’s closure. \\n \\n• Records of the bank’s external auditor at the offices of Hacker, Johnson & \\nSmith, in Tampa, Florida; and CPA Associates in Bradenton, Florida.   \\n APPENDIX 1 \\n• Bank records maintained by DRR in Dallas, Texas.  \\n \\n• Pertinent DSC policies and procedures. \\n \\n • Interviewed the following FDIC officials: \\n• DSC management in Washington, D.C.; Atlanta, Georgia; and Tampa, \\nFlorida.   \\n \\n• DRR officials at the Dallas Regional Office. \\n \\n• FDIC examiners from the DSC Tampa Field Office who participated in FPB \\nexaminations.   \\n \\n• Met with officials from the State of Florida’s Office of Financial Regulation in \\nTallahassee, Florida, to discuss their historical perspective of the institution, its \\nexaminations, state banking laws, and other activities regarding the state’s \\nsupervision of the bank. \\n \\n• Researched various banking laws and regulations, including State of Florida \\nbanking laws. \\n \\n \\nInternal Control, Reliance on Computer-processed Information, Performance  \\nMeasurement, and Compliance With Laws and Regulations \\n \\nDue to the limited nature of the audit objectives, we did not assess DSC’s overall internal \\ncontrol or management control structure.  We performed a limited review of FPB’s \\nmanagement controls pertaining to its operations as discussed in the finding section of \\nthis report.  For purposes of the audit, we did not rely on computer-processed data to \\nsupport our significant findings or conclusions.  Our review centered on interviews, \\nROEs, and correspondence and other evidence to support our audit.   \\n \\nThe Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (the Results Act) directs \\nExecutive Branch agencies to develop a customer-focused strategic plan, align agency \\nprograms and activities with concrete missions and goals, manage and measure results to \\njustify appropriations and authorizations, and design budgets that reflect strategic \\nmissions.   For this material loss review, we did not assess the strengths and weaknesses \\nof DSC’s annual performance plan in meeting the requirements of the Results Act \\nbecause such an assessment was not part of the audit objectives.  DSC’s compliance with \\nthe Results Act is reviewed in OIG program audits of DSC operations.   \\n \\n Regarding compliance with laws and regulations, we performed tests to determine \\nwhether the FDIC had complied with the provisions of PCA and limited tests to \\ndetermine compliance with certain aspects of the FDI Act.   Additionally, we assessed the \\nrisk of fraud and abuse related to our objectives in the course of evaluating audit \\nevidence. \\n \\n \\n30 \\nAPPENDIX 2 \\nGLOSSARY OF TERMS \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n31 \\nTerm \\nDefinition \\nAdversely Classified \\nAssets \\nAssets subject to criticism and/or comment in an ROE.   Adversely classified \\nassets are allocated on the basis of risk (lowest to highest) to three \\ncategories: \\n• \\nSubstandard,  \\n• \\nDoubtful, and  \\n• \\nLoss.  \\n \\n \\n Concentration \\nA concentration is a significantly large volume of economically related \\nassets that an institution has advanced or committed to a certain industry, \\nperson, entity, or affiliated group.   These assets may, in the aggregate, \\npresent a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of the institution.   \\n \\n \\nLoan Loss Reserve also \\ncalled Allowance for Loan \\nand Lease Losses (ALLL) \\nFederally insured depository institutions must maintain an ALLL level that \\nis adequate to absorb the estimated credit losses associated with the loan \\nand lease portfolio (including all binding commitments to lend).  To the \\nextent not provided for in a separate liability account, the ALLL should also \\nbe sufficient to absorb estimated loan losses associated with off-balance \\nsheet loan instruments such as standby letters of credit.   \\n \\n \\nMemorandum of \\nUnderstanding (MOU) \\nAn informal corrective administrative action for institutions considered to \\nbe of supervisory concern but which have not deteriorated to the point \\nwhere they warrant formal administrative action.  As a general rule, an \\nMOU is to be considered for all institutions rated a composite 3. \\n \\n \\nPrompt Corrective Action \\n(PCA) \\nThe purpose of PCA is to resolve the problems of insured depository \\ninstitutions at the least possible long-term cost to the DIF.   Part 325 of the \\nFDIC Rules and Regulations, 12 Code of Federal Regulations section \\n325.101, et. seq., implements section 38, Prompt Corrective Action, of the \\nFDI Act, 12 United States Code section 1831(o), by establishing a \\nframework for taking prompt supervisory actions against insured \\nnonmember banks that are less than adequately capitalized.  The following \\nterms are used to describe capital adequacy:  Well Capitalized, Adequately \\nCapitalized, Undercapitalized, Significantly Undercapitalized, and Critically \\nUndercapitalized. \\n \\n \\nUniform Bank \\nPerformance Report \\n(UBPR) \\n \\n The UBPR is an individual analysis of a financial institution’s financial data \\nand ratios that includes extensive comparisons to peer group performance.  \\nThe Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council produces the UBPR \\nquarterly, from Call Report data submitted by banks, for use by banking \\nsupervisors, bankers, and the general public.   \\n \\n \\n \\nAPPENDIX  3 \\n \\nCORPORATION COMMENTS \\n \\n \\nAPPENDIX 3 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n33 \\nAPPENDIX 3 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n34 \\nAPPENDIX 4 \\nACRONYMS IN THE REPORT \\n \\n \\n35 \\n \\nAcronym \\nDefinition \\nADC \\nAcquisition, Development, and Construction \\nALLL \\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses \\nARO \\nAtlanta Regional Office \\nBOD \\nBoard of Directors \\nCAMELS \\nCapital, Asset Quality, Management, Earnings, Liquidity, and \\nSensitivity to Market Risk \\nCD \\nCertificate of Deposit \\nC&D \\nCease and Desist \\nCFO \\nChief Financial Officer \\nCLP \\nContingency Liquidity Plan \\nCRE \\nCommercial Real Estate \\nCRP \\nCapital Restoration Plan \\nDIF \\nDeposit Insurance Fund \\nDRR \\nDivision of Resolutions and Receiverships \\nDSC \\nDivision of Supervision and Consumer Protection \\nFDI \\nFederal Deposit Insurance \\nFHLB \\nFederal Home Loan Bank \\nFIL \\nFinancial Institution Letter \\nFPB \\nFirst Priority Bank \\nGAAP \\nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles \\nLPO \\nLoan Production Office \\nMOU \\nMemorandum of Understanding \\nOFR \\nOffice of Financial Regulation \\nOIG \\nOffice of Inspector General \\nPCA \\nPrompt Corrective Action \\nROE \\nReport of Examination \\nUBPR \\nUniform Bank Performance Report \\nUFIRS \\nUniform Financial Institution Rating System \\n \\n  "
